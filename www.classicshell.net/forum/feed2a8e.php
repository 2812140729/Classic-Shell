If you set &quot;Pinned Programs folder&quot; to &quot;Use Start Menu folder&quot; then if you drag a folder onto the first column you will get an expandable shortcut to that folder (instead of a plain shortcut).<br /><br />Change the &quot;Small icon size&quot; and &quot;Large icon size&quot; values in the &quot;Menu Look&quot; tab to control the size of the icons.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Fri Mar 21, 2014 12:09 am</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2349&amp;p=11608#p11608"><![CDATA[
On a 32-bit Win7sp1 laptop that I am trying to set up for someone else, I am having ENORMOUS problems arranging the 4.0.4 Classic Start Menu to be usable. On my own laptop, long ago I knew the following:<br /><br />1) How to shrink the icons in the initial left column, so that that there is more vertical room between each item. Now I can't remember how to do that, and I can't find the answer anywhere.<br /><br />2) Long ago (back in Classic Start Menu 3.x.x days on my computer), I knew how to drag a folder from Column2 to Column1. I probably also knew how to create a new Column1 folder (of my own invention) into which I could drag something from Column2.<br /><br />I am now using 4.0.4, but when I upgraded from version 3.x, gradually to 4.0.4, I don't think I had to drag much stuff around because the upgrades didn't mess up the start menu. So I have forgotten what I once knew.<br /><br />On the computer I am setting up for someone else, now when I drag something that looks like a folder to me from the second column to the first column, I get a new label that says that the folder I have just dragged is a shortcut. And the original column 2 folder that I tried to drag into column 1 (but instead created a short cut) remains in its original column 2 location.<br /><br />Please Note: I am NOT writing about columns in the Customize tab of a Settings table. I am writing about moving things around within a Classic Start Menu, at the left edge of the computer window.<br /><br />I would very much appreciate any comments, suggestions, or specific help. I have spent almost an entire day trying to re-organize the initially quite messy Start Menu that version 4.0.4 created.<br /><br />Cordially, but desperately, R.N. (Roger) Folsom<br /><br />================================================================<br /><br />P.S. Since my message above, I have discovered that right-clicking any item above Programs in Column1 generates a menu that includes a New Folder setting. And it is possible to continue doing that and creating a lot of customized New Folders with different names.<br />Then it is possible to drag folders (and their contents) that initially are subfolders in Programs into one of the newly created folders.<br />(I have done that once, moving the ClipMate folder (a subfolder of Programs) into a newly created 0 Accessories folder, so that the ClipMate folder was a subfolder of 0 Accessories. But dragging a Program subfolder onto the Start Menu Column1 doesn't work.)<br />Therefore, many items that are in a Program folder have to be dragged one-by-one into one of the Column1 New Folders.<br />If I discover any additional information about this, I will post it here.<br /><em><strong>I still don't know to shrink the icons in the initial left column.</strong></em><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=487">RNFolsom</a> — Thu Mar 20, 2014 6:28 pm</p><hr />
