This skin is based on the user interface design from a mod for a game called Spore. The mod ports the UI, among many other things, from another slightly related game, Darkspore. The mod is called &quot;Dark Injection&quot; and the UI is new to version 9.r , so that's where the name came from. I've been working on this for <em>months</em>. I officially have no idea how to clean it up any further. If anyone wants to develop it further, PLEASE DO! I can provide unflattened PSDs and resource images as necessary.<br /><br /><a href="../../www.mediafire.com/file/4c5qyxnt86m9dmm/Dark%2bInjection%2b9.r%2bCSM.html" class="postlink">DOWNLOAD HERE</a>

Heck, after my computer imploded back in April, I had to put up with the Windows 8 Start <em>Screen</em> for a little while, before finding out that CSM works in memory. I could've gotten by with the Modern UI, but the instant CSM became an option, I reinstalled it.<br /><br />K, so if there is interest within 7 days, then that's that, and if not, then we duel it out?

Passing art in high school, did not help with this skin. <br />Ran into problems with the main menu. It has those old tv type aliasing lines, which look neat, but create havoc,<br />when stretching any amount. When I used the blend technique for only the 2 stretch pixels, it worked, but the menu won't shrink.<br /><br />All the text and buttons go towards top of menu, leaving a big space at bottom for single style.<br />Even the &quot;Column Padding&quot; in &quot;Customize Start Menu&quot; for single, does not push the shutdown buttons &amp; text down to bottom of menu.<br />It does for two column though. Maybe it's a bug?<br />I have shrunk the main menu three times now, wasting many, many hours, as well as losing more of the aliasing lines effect. <br />Still not enough. Arrrrggghhh. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />I don't even want to show what I have so far. I will get back to it, just not this weekend. <br />Just need more time for creative solving sparks to happen in my brain. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />To leave on a good note. That submenu, that I used, and that you also made into a picture frame, is the easiest to adapt. <br />That is a great graphic artist, who made the original. <br /><br />Addition.<br />Right now I'm looking at my main menu, and it is totally transparent, because the bitmap number is wrong.<br />There is just a tiny little dot on the left. Hay, maybe ZoNi is still interested in full 100% transparent menu. <br />Sure is hard to see text. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Gonna call it a happy mistake.

The slicing is by far the hardest to work out. Every pixel has to add up to the correct total width.<br />The vertical measurement has to add up to half of total height.<br /><br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />The second column looks grand.

A simpler earlier mutation. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />Will probably need to disable menu shadow in CSM settings.<br /><br />To make the submenu, and user picture frame, I copied bits from images in the pie folder, and joined them together. <br />This was the smoked glass skin, that has glass color available in options. <br />I left it in. Because I did not make a grey bitmap,<br />the blue tint in the bitmap clashes with some weird glass colors. <br />Mostly it's ok I think, cause it looks like smoke. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The other skin that turned into a dogs breakfast, is still in shambles.<br />That one is more complicated, but complexity does not mean better looking. <br />It might take weeks for that one, or maybe it deserves on back burner forever?<br />Time will tell. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Edit: Changed the new programs button from yellow to blueish.

I used &quot;Gaussian Blur&quot; with a dark blue around the edge.<br />I thought it was an unwritten law that a new button had to look as vomity as possible.<br />MS sure does plaster the menu with almost daily updates!<br /><br />Don't understand about the small icon/no icon. It's Ivo's code labels. <br />Can the skin use text to turn off icons in both column now?<br /><br />Zombie. Sure I'll take anything free.

However if you are using Ivo's code(which allows proper translation) then you might aswell keep it how it is, because they can just see what it does after checking it XD)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm sorry. I still don't quite understand the missing icon issue.<br /><br />Do the 16 or 32 size icons disappear on the menu itself, or is it the localization # to local language,<br />that is missing?<br />I don't know how to solve it, as I don't see problem on Win10 or Win7. I have computer set to English.<br />All works fine.<br />Reading the skin tutorial, it says it looks up the string number in the DLL. Does that mean the skin file got corrupt, or is that DLL in the operating system? <br /><br />On the next pie skin, I will put an option to have the subtle little &quot;N&quot; as a choice.<br />No matter what color is used with glass color skin, there will always be color clash, unless of course,<br />if the new programs color could be a Metro tracking color. That's a thought. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
