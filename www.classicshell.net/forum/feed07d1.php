<title type="html"><![CDATA[Jewelry Start Buttons]]></title>

So I still had female oriented start buttons on the brain and forgot the most obvious, jewelry. Two different color rings are below. I went with only two states because the third state was an awkward transition (ie too jerky). Diamond rings I tried just didn't show up. Seems like you need a big pop of color to be useful at 40 pixels. So these are limited as too what wallpaper you can match them too.<br /><br />This is the last start button I plan on making. I completed all of the buttons I had on my mind and then some. It's a pretty large and diverse collection; rotating propeller (animated), go for launch (animated), holidays, heels, flowers, and jewelry (14 start buttons in all).<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest â€” Mon Feb 01, 2016 11:09 am</p><hr />
