		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Last week, on my 64-bit Win7sp1 laptop, I upgraded Classic Start Menu 4.0.2 to 4.0.4 while in an Administrator account. (I also upgraded Classic Explorer and Classic IE9.) All went well. But a few days later, when in a User Standard account, I was surprised to see that the Start Menu Programs list ended with an item that I had never seen before: A folder labeled &lt;No Text&gt; which was empty. It did not appear in my Administrator account's Classic Start Menu Programs list, or anywhere else.<br /><br />I have been using computers since 1983 (although I'm not technically knowledgeable), and I can't remember ever seeing &lt;No Text&gt; before.<br /><br />I tried to delete the &lt;No Text&gt; folder (selecting it and using the Delete key), but nothing happened. So I went to my Administrator account, temporarily changed my User Standard account to be an Administrator account, went back to my User Account (now an Administrator Account), but I the delete key still would not delete the &lt;No Text&gt; empty folder.<br /><br />I also tried dragging &lt;No Text&gt; out of the Programs list (using a left click, and when that didn't work a right click), but again nothing happened.<br /><br />I also used Windows Explorer to search for &lt;No Text&gt;, but I got no hits --- not even for the Classic Start Menu Programs &lt;No Text&gt; folder. And I searched the registry for &quot;&lt;No Text&gt;&quot; (without the quotes), and again got no hits.<br /><br />And it is entirely possible that something other than Classic Start Menu 4.0.4 created &lt;No Text&gt;. For example, I have been extending my use of Acronis backups onto Western Digital Passport external disks.<br /><br />Having &lt;No Text&gt; as the last item in Classic Start Menu Programs list is not a problem, because the &lt;No Text&gt; empty folder doesn't take up much space, and it doesn't do anything.<br /><br />But it is a weird item, so I would like to remove it, or at least to know what put it there. If anyone reading knows anything about &lt;No Text&gt; (which I had never seen before, in any context), I would appreciate any information, including how to delete it.<br /><br />R.N.

For example, you may have the &quot;Recent programs&quot; item added which might say &lt;No text&gt; because it has text no label by default.</div>GauravK:<br /><br />That was an excellent example. Before I read your message, on my User (non-Administrator) account, the Customize Start Menu tab, in the left COLUMN PADDING column, Programs had only one item: Recent Programs. (The actual programs list, when I looked at my Classic Start Menu, had fifteen folders, two additional items not in a folder, and &lt;No Text&gt;.)<br /><br />And when I clicked on Recent Programs, and open Edit Menu Item (Recent programs), Label has &lt;No Text&gt;, and Link, Tip, and Icon are empty. I tried deleting &lt;No Text&gt;, and it deleted but as soon as I exit Edit Menu Item (Recent programs) --- either by x or by OK --- I saw a quick flash of &lt;No Text&gt; coming back. Alternatively, clicking on Restore Defaults also restored &lt;No Text&gt;.<br /><br />So I deleted Recent Programs. And then &lt;No Text&gt; was forced to disappear.<br /><br />Programs remained in the left COLUMN PADDING column, but now nothing is listed in it.<br /><br />My Programs list no longer ends with &lt;No Text&gt;.<br /><br />In short, I think the problem is fixed.<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />R.N.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah. By default Recent Programs doesn't have a label because it doesn't correspond to any real folder from which to take name. You have to enter some text for the label.<br />BTW the purpose of the Recent Programs item is to show the recent (or frequent) programs in a submenu instead of in the main menu. If you delete the item the programs will show in the main menu.
