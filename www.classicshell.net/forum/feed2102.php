Yea, if you care about cpu cycles, the built in taskmanager actually does the job pretty well, and can sit in your system tray<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Fri Jan 08, 2016 12:25 pm</p><hr />

Even if this were possible, this would introduce too much ambiguity and complexity besides potentially breaking a lot of things. If the button was placed in the middle, where would pinned programs go and where would running programs display their button? If the button was placed on the right, where should the Show Desktop/Aero Peek button go and where would the Date/Time go? It's put on the left for a reason - the rest of the elements can't be moved elsewhere to arbitrary positions as the taskbar is under Microsoft's control.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Thu Jan 07, 2016 11:40 pm</p><hr />

Hi all<br /> <br /><br /><br />This is a request .for you clever dev's to add an option in settings to move the start button from it's default position to also the middle or right of the taskbar.. this would be especially useful to multi--monitor users or folks like me who hate it on the left.. yeah it's true you can move the task bar from the bottom to the top and right to left of the screen but not the actual start button on the taskbar... Thanks in advance and keep up the great work you are doing..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12405">DZOOM</a> — Thu Jan 07, 2016 6:48 am</p><hr />
