Awhile ago they got mad that Classic Shell was including their logo with it (so that Windows 8 users could have a start button with the Windows logo). That's long passed now though. Windows 8.1 had a start button so there was no reason for Classic Shell to include one anyway. I haven't heard of  anything since then.

Extended support is for businesses I believe<br /><br />A true windows shell... IE you take windows, you scrap explorer.exe, and all the built in stuff.. (maintaining .exe and driver support) and re-code the rest as an open source 'patch' The user then buys (or downgrades) to X version of windows. and applies your 'patch' Something like this would be complicated enough that it would likely only support a single version of windows (which the user would be tasked with pre-installing, through legal or other means)

Like, who cares if you can't get the newest version of Office or something? The older version works just fine. I don't use many programs that are the absolute newest version. Someone just needs to make a program that routes your internet connection through a Linux VM that has a new web browser. I'd be set for life with that.

But one good news is that Win10 does not change the Win32 APIs significantly because MS wants to deprecate it. This means, all future classical apps will be basically compatible with Win8.1 and Win7.

Honestly there was a way to get rid of tearing under XP that I used. One needs an old Nvidia hardware and the old driver and D-Sub connection with monitor. Then there was a checkbox in dialog.
