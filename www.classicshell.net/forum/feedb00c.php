GauravK:<br /><br />Thank you SO SO MUCH! That solved all the problems I mentioned, as well as a couple more that I had not. I printed everything, so hopefully next time it won't occur.<br /><br />I guess it was just too long ago that I set up Classic Shell on my laptop. <br /><br />And I do really need to find a primer on all of Windows correct terminology.<br /><br /><br />Harry<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=64">ac1210</a> — Mon May 05, 2014 12:24 pm</p><hr />

The first problem is that you are confusing the status bar with the Details pane. You can turn on the status bar from the View menu of Explorer. It is off by default. The status bar is where Classic Shell's Explorer addin adds back the useful details. The Details pane shows similar information. You can turn it off by pressing the Organize button -&gt; Layout -&gt; Details Pane. Classic Shell's Explorer toolbar also has a button to quickly toggle the Details pane.<br /><br />Your second problem might be solved from Explorer's Folder Options. Click the Tools menu -&gt; Folder Options. On the General tab, make sure that &quot;Automatically expand to current folder&quot; is checked.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Mon May 05, 2014 11:20 am</p><hr />

I have Classic Shell 4.1.0 installed on two Windows 7 Pro (64 bit) computers. One is a laptop, which I have had for a couple of years. The second is a desktop that I just had built.<br /><br />There appears to be a big difference in what is seen when I open Explorer, and also when I create a shortcut. Perhaps someone can help me sort this out.<br /><br />I have two attachments. The first, CshellFootLaptop.gif shows the difference on what I believe is called the Status row (at the bottom of the screen). The top picture is from my laptop, and is what Classic Shell shows on your webpage, and is what I want. The bottom picutre is from my desktop. Note that all you see is an icon. I have double checked my Classic Shell Explorer settings, and they appear to be identical. <br /><br />Any idea what is causing this and how I fix it?<br /><br />The second may not be related to Classic Shell, but since that is what I am using to create my shortcuts, I thought I would ask. See the second attachment, CshellScut.gif. [I may not be using the correct terminology below, so forgive me]<br /><br />Screen shot #1 shows that I have selected C:\Users\Valued Client (my primary User account) and then Send to Desktop (create shortcut). The result is screen #2. Valued Client has opened, and all of it's subfolders are listed under Valued Client in the Folder section (the left one) . These two screen shots were taken from my laptop, and are exactly what I want to see when I open via the shortcut.<br /><br />Now look at screen shots #3 and #4. These are from my desktop. in #3 I have selected C:\Users\HMW (my primary User account on the desktop) and then Send to Desktop; just as before. However the result is quite different. Although C:\Users\HMW appears on the command line at the top (as underlined in red). Local Disk (C:) is all that appears in the folder section, and the contents of C:\Users\HMW only show in the section on the right.<br /><br />Again, any idea what is causing this and how I fix it? I want my desktop to match my laptop.<br /><br /><br />Harry<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=64">ac1210</a> — Mon May 05, 2014 10:09 am</p><hr />
