Try restarting it several times right when the windows logo pops up, this should prompt for a 'checking for boot problems' depending on which OS you have, your options from here will be different. but try to boot into safemode, or at the very least open a command prompt. From command prompt, you can try both <br />sfc /scannow<br />and<br />chkdsk /r /f<br /><br />The first will check for bad/corrupted system files; the second will check for bad sectors on the harddrive<br />if those dont work, you can try a system restore, or system refresh (on windows 10)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's a horrible feeling when the operating system won't work.<br /><br />By any chance, do you have multiple boot drives, and are using Win 8,8.1,10? <br /><br />If fast boot, hibernate is enabled, and you switch drives back and forth, boot up errors will occur.<br />In my cases, Windows detected errors &amp; tried to repair, and totally screwed up drive.<br />Upon reboot, Windows says can not fix. Require full op install. WTH. <br />Found out it put the Master Boot Record on another drive that was installed!<br /><br />Thankfully on two occasions, I used Macrium rescue boot disk, and it fixed the MBR back to drive C. <br />The other time, nothing worked. Ran out of time, and patience. Backed up files to another drive, <br />put in older system image, and put back my backed up files.<br /><br />If you do have that kind of multidrive setup, and get it to boot into operating system again,<br />make sure to disable the fast boot and hibernation in Windows settings as well as in CSM settings.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Other possiblities.<br /><br />Did it just do it suddenly, or has it been on and off for a while?<br />What can happen is the electrolytic capacitors in either the power supply, or motherboard dry out.<br />They won't be able to filter the high frequency switching ripple on the power supply lines, <br />and create all kinds of weird problems, once the system starts to draw more current.<br />I've seen, and fixed a number of those bad caps on people's computers, DVD players etc. <br />Sometimes the caps, (they look like aluminum cans with plastic wrapper on them),<br />look like they became pregnant, ready to explode. They will tend to leak electrolyte onto pcboard.<br />Other ones look normal, but have changed into a low value capacitance in series with a high resistance.<br /><br />Ransomware virus?<br />Probably unlikely, because a non booting OP is useless to them and you, <br />unless there was a screen that showed up detailing hard drive is encrypted.<br /><br /><br />There must be free IT help forums out there somewhere.

Not all of the cans have pressure release slits on the side or top.<br />Made a nice dent in my bedroom ceiling, with a fishy smell of the electrolyte lasting for a day.<br />That was my mistake. A wee bit too much reverse current. <br />An engineer later told me if it had less current, the cap would turn into a bipolar half value. <br />Luckily more and more manufacturers are using solid tantalum capacitors that don't dry out.<br /><br />Getting back to computer not working. Hardware related.<br />Sometimes if a computer is moved, a circuit board could pop out of its connector.<br />The gold fingers on the cards edge lose contact. Happens a lot with video cards, sometimes ram sticks when not clicked in.<br />When the computer starts up, before loading operating system, it checks to see what it's connected to.<br />If anything wrong, there is usually some text on screen, or some extra beeps.<br />Was there anything like that?<br /><br />Was a firmware update done before computer could not boot?<br />Even a seized up fan/loose heat sink can make problems too, though after a minute or two.<br /><br />Yeah. Just google some key words of your specific computer problem, and there are a number of help forums that show up.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br /><br />This is really off topic.<br />I just saw a Doritos advert. So funny.<br />The wife is having a pregnancy ultrasound, along with her husband who is eating Doritos at the time.<br />Wherever the chips go, baby will follow.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
