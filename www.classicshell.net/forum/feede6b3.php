It is impossible to get back system colours is windows 8 but classicstart has system colours and msgina.dll style functionality with the boxed shutdown.<br />Many users are pissed at not having aero or classic mode in win8 but maybe classicshell can include a theme-manager that overrides the settings of the broken windows 8 themes along with bringing back tabbing icons instead of this horrible horrible big miniature tabbing .<br /><br />The question is how?<br />1. Using current code to make it into a fully customizable explorer replacement as an alternate download where people can make it look exactly win95 / 98 / 2000 / XP etc styles would be ideal since classicstart already covers so many things . it would faciliate removing memory hogging services and make it games a faster experience .  Iconed tabbed browsing  can be done unfortunately the only way to do it is to disable dwm.exe in windows 8 which renders explorer.exe useless but classic tabbing still shows up from time to time . An alternative to Explorer.exe would make us disable useless services as dcomlaunch and dcom  along with dwm.exe and we could tailor our system to work the way we want it instead of the way Microsoft want us to use it which would also remove non wanted tap screen to open usb drive messages etc .<br /><br /><br />2. While i agree that workarounds are possible it could be a cleaner and faster way to replace explorer completely and facilitate portability for the upcoming versions of windows where we risk to even lose the desktop copy paste and multitasking features. Knowing how microsoft thinks it would come as no surprise if they remove even more features and add useless junk in their place. The making of an alternative explorer would partially be a trial and error process for making it load in place of explorer.exe .<br /><br /><br />3. The benefit would be the customization and ease of modding could improve and we could for example use a classic theme with glass transparency style where the white in the windows is supposed to be at change icons with ease by having all system icons in only 1 dll (microsoft keeps old as new icons in one big mess in their dlls classicstartmenu as an explorer.exe could load fewer icons from a custom dll ) add back the NT style login box etc . More modding more fun ...<br /><br /><br />4 I hope the community listens to this and i would like to thank Ivo for giving us the classic startmenu back.<br /><br /><br />I hate to see the project abandoned just because microsoft messed things up too much thats why i am for a replacement<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1059">powerplayer</a> — Sun Jul 07, 2013 8:31 pm</p><hr />

Interesting ideas, we've thought similarly about grouping and reducing folder complexity but there are certain considerations.<br /><br />Grouping if implemented must be done so in a manner such that it doesn't break shortcuts for uninstallers. When a program is uninstalled, its shortcuts must get cleanly removed. Windows Installer shortcuts (advertised shortcuts) should not even be renamed or its self-repair functionality kicks in. If the shortcuts are moved and put inside folders named by category, then they break for uninstallers.<br /><br />For folders which include links to multiple EXEs, e.g. Microsoft Office, there isn't a definite way to determine that Word is the &quot;main application&quot;. It can be Excel or PowerPoint, it can wrongly pick any EXE. But we get your idea.<br /><br />Power options: You can already do it yourself. In fact, Classic Shell's Start Menu is one of the few which can do it. Go to Customize Start Menu tab in Start Menu settings, add a Custom Command from the right column by dragging it to the left column. Double click in the left column to edit its command, label, tooltip and icon. Including all commands out-of-the-box is a challenge because the Start Menu terms must be localized using MUI technology into all supported languages. But you can define them yourself and save the configuration to an XML.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sun Apr 28, 2013 12:33 am</p><hr />

@grouping icons; well you could put the links in a folder, but yea it might be cool if you could have collapsable groups<br /><br />@single click open; you can assign sub-items to an executable, so double clicking will run it, and single click will open a sub menu with whatever else you add<br /><br />@ power options, Im pretty sure you can already<br />shutdown timer: <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=281" class="postlink">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=281</a><br />and the other 2 should not be to hard to figure out, although alot of these commands should be included out of the box, without having to search..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sat Apr 27, 2013 10:05 pm</p><hr />

Hi there,<br /><br />I've been looking around the internet for a start menu application for my Windows 8 OS. <br /><br />I've used Classic Shell before and I love the program but on my search I found a few interesting features that Classic Shell could maybe incorporate. <br /><br />- Grouping Programs<br /><br />Organizing programs into different groups on the start menu. Groups by criteria such as: Games, Utilities, Programming, Video, Music, System, Internet. <br />Perhaps even making the groups collapsible would be a great idea.<br /><br />- Single Click Open<br /><br />Opening programs in folders by a single click. As in click on the Microsoft Word folder and it opens the main application by linking the executable to the folder.<br /><br />- Power Options<br /><br />Simple options for power buttons like: Force Shutdown, timer shutdown, remote shutdown.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=671">priestfeast</a> — Sat Apr 27, 2013 9:53 pm</p><hr />
