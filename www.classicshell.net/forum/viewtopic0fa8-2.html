Try these things to see if any of them makes a difference:<br />1) Use the Classic Shell button instead of the Windows 10 button, or vice versa<br />2) Hide the Search button in the taskbar (or show it if it is hidden)<br />3) Disable Aero Glass<br /><br />Also keep a Process Explorer opened in admin mode and look for another process that may be doing something expensive from time to time - like AV software or a service or something.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OK, I'll try those things.  It's a bit slow to test since it doesn't happen all the time.  My normal setup:<br /><br />ClassicShell button is mine, derived from your shell.<br />AV software is Microsoft's Defender.  <br />Running processes minimized.  When nothing much is running, they number in the mid to high 40s.<br />Search button / field in the taskbar is off.<br />Aero Glass is on.<br />UAC is off.<br /><br />I have a suspicion it may have to do with my running UAC-disabled.  Unfortunately we've moved past where Microsoft even remotely supports operating in that manner.  If a delay is the worst thing that results from that, I can probably live with it.<br /><br />-Noel

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><span style="font-size: 85%; line-height: 116%;">I'm not sure if it's right to post in an old thread on this forum, but as I've noticed something about this issue I see no point in creating a new one.</span><br /><br />I've had this delay too when showing the Start Menu (4.2.7).<br />I've tested several things, and found out that <em>showing the frequent programs</em> with <strong>Show recent Metro Apps</strong> ticked causes the menu to take a long time to open. <em>Showing recent programs</em> with <strong>Show recent Metro Apps</strong> ticked makes it a bit faster, but there's still a delay. Disabling <strong>Show recent Metro Apps</strong> removes that delay almost completely in both cases.<br /><br />To make it even faster, it's also possible to just show nothing (I mean, no recent/frequent programs), also to <em>disable jumplists</em>, and <em>sort the main menu only the first time</em>. But these ones only make light improvements, the main reason for the delay is indeed the recent Metro Apps. At least for me.
