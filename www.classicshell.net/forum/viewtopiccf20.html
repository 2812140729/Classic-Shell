That follows Windows 7 style user picture.<br /><br /><br />This Darkstar Revived skin was very hard to get working without stretching distortion, <br />due to the angle line at the top. The silver bars do move around. <br />No guarantee menu won't distort if using non-default English settings. <br />The left column has so little splices room, because of the 45-degree angle black line,<br />that if reduced in size too much, the 1st column will fold over onto itself (gets eaten). <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />I had to modify the programs, and bottom area, to make the new search view work correctly.<br /><br />At high dot per inch size options, I had to keep some parts to stay small, to avoid overlapping onto other elements.<br /><br />If you disable search box in CSM settings, 1st column padding is adjusted for that.<br /><br />The grey selector button on the grey menu looks ok, but when it's in front of a dark menu, it's a bit like lipstick on a pig. <br />I left the option turned on only for the submenu, not the main menu 1st column. <br />Shoot, now I just enabled it again. Maybe it's comical looking on certain days, not others. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />I wanted to put the XP shutdown icon button further left, but ran into a problem. I had to make menu alpha opacity,<br />because of the tiny transparent sliver at top of the menu. That opacity left certain text zones that can't be crossed. <br />So I had to back off as a compromise.<br /><br /><br />The bad news.<br />My intentions did not work out so well.<br />If I try the real Darkstar theme with Start10 start menu, and WindowBlinds on Win10, the original menu half works.<br />I wanted to make this Classic Shell skin to use with WindowBlinds without their Start10 start menu.<br />It did not work. WindowBlinds overrides all Classic Shell menu text color and makes it all black and tiny. <br />The same old problem as other people have.<br />No adjustment of WindowBlinds settings fixed anything. <br />After uninstalling the trial WindowBlinds program, <br />it had permanently altered the blue system highlight color. Had to go into the registry to put back the correct color. <br />Stardock's software isn't as bad from some years ago, where it permanently changed folder icons, shortcut arrows. <br />Now that took a restore with thumbnail cache delete to get back to normal. <br />With Classic Shell, I have never had any problem with system files permanently changed. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />So all in all, it was a waste of time porting it for what I wanted it for.<br />This menu skin is only good as a stand-alone, without WindowBlinds, unless somebody knows something?<br />I have included taskbar parts to help bring out the feel of Darkstar. <br /><br />I have to give a lot of credit to The Skins Factory, for making such a superb theme menu.<br />It has so many interesting parts to it. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Other<br />About High dots per inch mode.<br />For the enlarged menu bitmaps, I initially used exact borders and the blank menu areas got bigger.<br />It looked unnatural.<br />So I used the magnifier application on Win 10 Creators update, that has bitmap smoothing feature.<br />If I just enlarged menu bitmap in old graphics software with bicubic function, it would come out all fuzzy.<br />What the magnifier does is enlarge a 1-pixel line into either 1 pixel, or two-pixel thick line, <br />without making an extra shade pixel in between. The good news is final image looks sharper.<br />The drawback is rounding of sharp corners, and switching back'n forth between 1/2 pixel lines.<br />I edited out those bad effects that I could see. Some parts will be 1 to 2 pixels bigger than the others, <br />which alters their size ratios, but I still like it better than my first bicubic attempt.<br /><br />Making more original look.<br />Extra CSM settings for skinny (less wide) original look.<br />This is a stretching type menu, whereas the original is locked.<br />Go to CSM &quot;Main Menu&quot; tab, adjust &quot;Programs pane width&quot; to 36, &quot;Jumplist pane width&quot; to 30<br /><br />Original never had internal programs tree, so go back to CSM &quot;Main Menu&quot; tab, <br />switch &quot;All programs style&quot; to &quot;Cascading sub-menu&quot;.<br /><br />To turn off search box, go to &quot;Search Box&quot; tab, and click &quot;No search box&quot;.<br /><br />In skin options, switch &quot;Font size&quot; to &quot;XP small&quot;.<br /><br />That's about all I can do. It's a 7 style menu, so no icons on the second column. <br />I did put some other options in from buttons and such that I found in the theme file.<br /><br />Yay, my chicken scratchings have finished. Bye <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />EDIT: Added the buttons and skin in zip<br /><br />EDIT: Fixed issue with missing arrow on regular shutdown button. <br />Was just a big nothing button <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Now rev B

Maybe change one to match the other for consistency?<br /><br />With the 'clear inside' option selected  'all programs' becomes lighter when hovered.<br />In the un-hovered state 'all programs' is in a dark rectangle, while the '&lt;=Back' button doesn't match this theme<br /><br /><br />The apparent round edge on submenu's doesnt quite match the sharpness of the theme. maybe add a sharp color transition to the edge, instead of a gradient. (then it looks like its folded at a sharp angle)<br />The red bit on the top is a nice touch, it really sells the red hover effects

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking of centering the regular shutdown button, <br />but remembered how wide the second column gets in German, Russian languages.<br />The shutdown button won't have any space to go, and just pushes menu wider.<br />When I was remaking the shutdown icon buttons, I figured to reuse into a normal button. <br />That's why it has the hover lines at the bottom, cause it's the same button, just stretched. <br />Pretty much every selector button is same as original, just resized.<br />Yeah, the lower all programs button should get darker and stay dark, <br />but Classic Shell wants to do its own thing. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br />The mouse needs to be jiggled to show selector again.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Maybe Ivo set delay too short? <br /><br />Also, the original new programs button is a lighter grey. The full red new option is what I put in.<br />The clear inside buttons are what's on the original theme menu,<br />same as the submenu bitmaps, All programs arrows, etc.<br />I tried to make it look as original as possible, <br />except for extra option parts.<br />I am probably going to leave it the same unless there are big mistakes.<br />Yep, looking back at those big 3d submenus. WindowBlinds made a ton of menus like that. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

The white arrow will disappear.
