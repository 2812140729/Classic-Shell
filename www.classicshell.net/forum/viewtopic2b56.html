They tried to claim the name Start9 in 2013, yes, but that was before we knew there wasn't going to be a Windows 9, and prior to that, it would be an entirely logical assumption to assume that there would have been a Windows 9. Further supporting the idea that they don't care about that name anymore is the fact that their attempt to claim the name was officially abandoned not long after Windows 10's name was known. I figure that as long as I have a disclaimer somewhere, saying that there's no connection, I'll more than likely be fine.<br />Plus I've yet to think of any other names that don't sound awkward, stupid, or otherwise not fit for purpose <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

User enables Start9 Task View and/or Search Button/Bar<br />2. Start9 button area becomes wider than Classic Shell button area<br />3. Taskband is pushed aside and shrunken accordingly by Start9<br />4. User's running applications no longer fit into the available space, so Windows adds a scrollbar to the Taskband<br />5. The user wants to switch to an application on the second page, so they click the arrow on the scrollbar<br />6. Classic Shell sees this, siezes control of the Taskband's width, causing it to increase dramatically<br />7. Windows realizes the Taskband is now large enough to contain all of the user's applications on one page, removes scrollbar and second page, thus forcing the user back to the first page<br />8. Within a few frames, Start9 regains control of Taskband and pushes it back over, causing it to shrink again, which re-adds the scrollbar, but does not automatically scroll back to the second page, meaning the user is unable to access any applications that reside on the second page.<br />See the problem now? ._:-.<br /></div><br />Actually I'm having slight trouble visualizing it..
