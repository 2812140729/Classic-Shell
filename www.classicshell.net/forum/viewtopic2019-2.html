		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone. In <a href="http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=3348" class="postlink">this thread</a> I was working on a skin that contained every caption for every version of Windows. However, I though a thread like this would be more appropriate under the User Content forum.<br /><br />So I made a skin based on the default classic skin that contains the original classic start menu captions for every version of Windows (including beta versions). Now if anyone is wondering what the point of this is (seeing as how the default classic skin will already let you use custom text) it's actually quite simple. With the default classic skin, there is no way to have the fonts be completely accurate. For example, making the caption say 'Windows 2000 Professional' won't make it look like the original Windows 2000 caption, as the fonts and colors will likely be off. But with this skin, you can have it look exactly like whichever version of Windows you'd like (which is a lot).<br /><br />Keep in mind this is still a work in progress, so there may be issues with it. Feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, juniper. Yeah, the Windows 8 thing with the 3D borders is pretty annoying. But that screenshot you see (with the Windows 7 Professional caption) is actually Windows 8 with a classic theme, which can be enabled believe it or not (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?t=113024http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?t=113024">http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.ph ... p?t=113024</a><!-- m -->).<br />Too bad that's kind of impractical to use for most people though. I wonder if there's any way to force a 3D border without modifying the bitmap.<br /><br />Anyway, I've actually finished making all of the Windows 7 captions, and I'm currently working on the Windows 8 and Windows 10 ones. I'll post it as soon as I'm done.<br />Also I still need to get the Windows Server 2008 without Hyper-V captions. I just can't seem to find them though.

I can't imagine the horizontal caption bug would add text to the bitmap.<br /><br />Anyways, here's another update. The skin now includes captions for Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 10.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ok, so I've got an update for you guys! The download will be in the first post of this thread. Here are a list of changes:<br /><br />-Renamed the skin from 'Windows Classic' to 'Windows Classic Captions'<br />-New 'About this skin' dialog.<br />-Removed the 'No caption' option, as it is kind of pointless for this skin.<br />-Better support for displaying the user name/user picture.<br />-Each caption uses an appropriate font for the username. For example, Windows 95/98/Me/NT use Microsoft Sans Serif, Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003 use Tahoma, and Windows Vista+ use Segoe UI.<br />-The icons in the Windows Codename Chicago variation now overlap the caption. This is not a bug, and it is in fact by design (see <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/windows/images/a/a8/Windowschicago189.png/revision/latest?cb=20120821222923" class="postlink">here</a>). This does not affect the 'Windows Codename Chicago (Thin)' variation.<br />-Added a variation for Windows 95 Beta, which currently uses a placeholder image. I'll update with the original caption as soon as I can (for those of you who want to see what it looks like, see <a href="../../sites.google.com/site/chicagowin95/_/rsrc/1266498185253/index/chicago222b/chic222dut-16.jpg" class="postlink">here</a>).<br />-Added 2 new custom caption variations<br />-Custom captions have been moved to the bottom of the skin variations list to make it easier to add more custom caption variations in the future (just in case I decide to do so).<br />-Moved some resources around internally<br />-A bit of a milestone. This skin alone now has 100 different variations to select!<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> When replacing the old skin with this one, you may have to re-select the caption you want manually due to the fact that resources in the skin have been moved around. <br /><br />I still need to find the Windows Server 2008 without Hyper-V captions. If anyone can send me a link to an ISO file of it, that would be great. If I'm missing any captions, please let me know and I will do my best to add them. And again, feel free to give any other thoughts or feedback. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!

Here's a list of changes:<br />-Added a Metro custom variant, which will use your start screen colors if your using Windows 8/8.1<br />-Custom Skin variations now have names attached to them. For example: 'Custom 1' is now called 'Custom 1 (Classic)' and 'Custom 2' is now called 'Custom 2 (Vista), ect.<br />-3D border is now enabled by default when using the Windows Classic theme. The flat border with the classic theme can still be enabled in the options.<br />-FINALLY added the Windows Server 2008 without Hyper-V captions (that certainly took long enough).<br /><br />Well that's about it. Except for one other change that probably won't affect the users who download this skin. I am no longer using Resource Hacker to update/change this skin. Instead, I'm using Microsoft Visual Studio to compile it as a resource-only DLL file. I was just sick of getting saving errors/glitches with Resource Hacker.<br /><br />Once again, I'm always open to feedback, so let me know if you have any. I would love to figure out a way to use a 3D border with visual styles, but I don't want to use a bitmap to achieve this to keep consistency between the start menu and the user's color/window metric settings.

Although it might. But since I've got it all set up for Visual Studio, I'll just stick with that for now. I'm fine with using it anyway.<br /><br />Also, sorry there's currently no download.

You could create a shortcut to C:\Program Files\Classic Shell\ClassicStartMenu.exe in your Start Menu Programs or Desktop folder. Then go to that shortcut's properties and assign a keyboard shortcut key so you can load CSM quickly after exiting it and saving the skin.<br /><br />I got saving errors in Resource Hacker too if CSM was running. Once I exit it, it never happens.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, junuper. I've been considering re-implementing support for the two-column mode. Keep in mind this skin is based on the default Classic Skin, so that's why it ends up looking similar. Actually, I originally had plans to completely remove the two-column mode from this skin, but then I realized that it might be cool to have it with a caption. So I went ahead and changed it to not hide the caption with two columns, and figured that I might work on it later. Until now, I had not actually tested the skin with two columns, but since it sounds you brought it up, I think I'll go ahead and fix it up. And don't worry, I won't forget about the custom variations. Expect that in the next update. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Let me clarify what I mean. When using two column mode, you can display any caption you'd like just fine. However, if you have any of the custom captions selected (the ones with names like Custom 1 (Classic), Custom 2 (Vista), ect.) the caption text will not appear. This seems to be a result of Classic Shell simply not supporting caption text with two columns like NoahNicholsFourm said. The reason every other caption works is because the text is part of the bitmap, and it therefore doesn't need to be rendered separately by Classic Shell.<br /><br />Also, are metro skins supported on Windows 10? The reason I ask is because I would like to know how the Metro variation (Custom 5) works on Windows 10.

If I ever have the time, I'd also like to do a version that always has 3D borders, but don't count on that (at least not anytime soon).

This is the biggest update I've done in a while, and it includes many new variations, as well as a few updates to some of the older variations.

This was extremely hard to find the original bitmap for.<br />-Added variations for all editions of Windows Vista.<br />-Updated the Windows 7 &amp; Windows Server 2008 R2 variations to use the Windows 7 version of Segoe UI<br />-Added some Windows Embedded 7/8 variations<br />-Added a Windows Home Server 2011 variation<br />-Added Windows MultiPoint Server 2011 variations for both editions<br />-Added a few new Windows Server 2012/2012 R2 variations (including Windows MultiPoint Server 2012)<br />-Swapped the colors for the Windows 8.1 and the Windows 10 variations (I think the darker colors are a bit more fitting for Windows 10 than they are for Windows 8.1)<br />-Added Windows Server 2016 variations (finally)<br /><br />I think that's about it. I wouldn't be surprised if I forgot to mention a few things, but that's all I can remember at the moment. In all honesty, this was probably one of the most difficult updates I've ever done with this skin, and that's part of the reason it took so long to complete. But I'm glad it's finally finished, and I'm still open to any feedback.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing. If anyone prefers the older variations, I've attached a zip folder to the first post containing the old bitmaps. You can re-apply them using Resource Hacker.<br /><br />Well, that's all for now. I'm really glad that so many people seem to enjoy this skin. It really does mean a lot to me, so thank you to everyone who has shown interest in this project.<br /><br />Enjoy!
