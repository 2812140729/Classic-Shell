		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary in IE, when suddenly an error message popped up saying something like, &quot;Classic IE has encountered a problem and needs to close.&quot; (I <span style="text-decoration: underline">have</span> to remember to take Screen Shots of these things!!!) Over that window, another window popped up (from Microsoft) asking if I wanted to report more details to Microsoft. I clicked on that windows &quot;Details&quot; arrow. The only relevant information was:<br />&quot;Files that help describe the problem:<br />C:\Users\G B\AppData\Local\Temp\WER4CF0.tmp.appcompat.txt<br />C:\Users\G B\AppData\Local\Temp\WER4D00.tmp.hdmp&quot;<br /><br />(I did report it to Microsoft; I figured, &quot;why not&quot;?)<br /><br />Apparently, everything resumed automatically without a hiccup. I just wanted to pass the error information along, in case it was important. In reaching the Forum, I notice that there is a slightly-newer version available, 4.0.2 (I am running 4.0.0). So I guess I will download that, just to keep current.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />cheebie

I was just trying to be helpful, in terms of helping with debugging. Ah, well, it's a process: live and learn! Thanks for your helpful replies, Jcee.<br /><br />cheebie

Doesn't IE10 come standard with Win 8? (unless you really work at it to downgrade to a lower version.)<br /> <br />(2) My &quot;Help|About...&quot; product statement says that I am running 10.0.9200.16736. A line under that seems to indicate that there is an &quot;Upgrade&quot; version available, 10.0.11, since Nov. 12 (KB2888505). I am set up for automatic upgrades, so I don't know why this hasn't upgraded itself. Do you think there is something to be gained by my upgrading to this most current version?<br /> <br />In short, it doesn't seem likely that a lack of &quot;IE10-ness&quot; contributed to the problems I was experiencing.<br /> <br /> <br />cheebie

I'm at a total loss &amp; nothing I have tried has worked. Please, anybody, can you help. I also get the message that that whatever website I'm trying to access is &quot;not responding&quot;  I'll try anything.

If I right click on the IE icon and right click on Internet Explorer from the list and select &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; it opens properly and goes to my Home Page. Any ideas? Everything else seems to work OK. Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Win 8.1<br />Lenovo Ideapad Laptop
