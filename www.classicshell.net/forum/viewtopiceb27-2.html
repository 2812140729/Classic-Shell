Most of Windows Explorer crashes (almost 100%) happened after attempt to update Nvidia (FeForce GTX 660) drivers from 358 to 361. It always finished with &quot;Install error&quot; until with &quot;Clean install&quot; I completely lost drivers. During that time after every restart Windows Explorer stopped working until restart in Task Manager.<br />Since then I erased old installs with Display Driver Uninstaller, recent driver installed and works so far without errors. Since upgrade Win7 to Win10 got maybe 2-3 WE not responding on those 358 drivers.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's entirely possible, but if so there's nothing I can do about it. The network or file server may well be congested at times and we've no money to replace (bits of) either. I imagine the problem is the same as in this thread:<br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicb8b6-3.html?f=12&amp;t=3256">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=3256</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Based on that, could we ask that something along the lines of what's requested there is included in the next version please? It would seem the dump I've provided (which is as far as the OP there got) confirms the issue reported back then.<br /><br />I realise the whole &quot;redirected AppData&quot; debate is ongoing, but we're in the same position as &quot;nathanlock&quot; - it's a school, so everyone is hot-desking all the time and mandatory profiles are in effect, so preserving AppData between sessions is the only way for students to be able to maintain a number of per-app settings. Also, in our case, there are no pinned apps and there never will be - we have it set to automatically skip them and open the All Programs folder. Ideally there could perhaps be an option for Classic Start Menu not to check that folder (or any folder) every time it's opened? Or just a &quot;disable pinned items&quot; option? Or could there just be a timeout of e.g. 5 seconds if it can't see it?<br /><br />Aside: &quot;GauravK&quot; notes in that other thread that changing the setting to &quot;Use Start Menu folder&quot; might help - but as I understand it, that would check the central folder in ProgramData along with the user's personal Start Menu folder - which is ALSO inside redirected AppData...<br /><br />Pretty, pretty, pretty please? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

If you restart Explorer through the Task Manager, everything is fine (but normal users can't do that and wouldn't know how to anyway). It almost seems like if it can't access the required location just momentarily, it becomes unusable indefinitely until restarted - which for most users will mean logging off/on.  That was what gave me the &quot;timeout&quot; idea.

Anything on AppData\Roaming is redirected to the same server, over the same network, so whether it's &quot;AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu&quot; or &quot;AppData\Roaming\ClassicShell\Pinned&quot; makes no difference. The problem occurs when accessing redirected folders, so the solution would be to not check anything that is redirected - i.e. not check for pinned apps at all in this case.

That would of course require the users using the new version to migrate the shortcuts from %appdata%\ClassicShell\Pinned to %Localappdata%\ClassicShell\Pinned but it would be a one time thing. Or the menu could move those shortcuts on its own.<br /><br />For those who want roaming pinned programs, they can use the Start Menu folder since it can be redirected.

Either way...<br />2) The Group Policy setting to redirect the Start Menu is designed to essentially point the &quot;All Programs&quot; folder list at the specified location.  It does NOT change the Windows &quot;pinned items&quot; location, which is still &quot;AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\StartMenu&quot;... and that is redirected because it's part of AppData\Roaming.<br /><br />The solution, then, would be an option to have the ClassicShell\Pinned folder created in - and subsequently accessed from - AppData\Local, rather than AppData\Roaming.

The Start menu folder itself (and its Programs subfolder) will be slow when it is redirected even if Pinned was inside %localappdata% defeating the purpose. First, try switching to the Start Menu folder and pin your shortcuts again. See if the slowdown goes away. If not, then it means the Start Menu folder is redirected and everything inside it (all the shortcuts in All Programs).

If changing the Pinned Programs folder works, it'll fix it for us, as we leave the Start Menu folder as part of the roaming profile, rather than redirecting the folder.

If you need to redirect the folders to a network location, it has to have the necessary performance characteristics to serve all the users you have connected to it. If the file share hangs then the start menu will hang as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I also have the same problem after I use classicshell in combination with Windows 10 and roaming profiles. I have two separate clients with small offices (e.g. 10 Windows10 pc's + 2012 AD / File server, Simple Gigabit Switch), on both offices the problem exists on all machines when using classicshell. After some right clicking, the taskbar and start menu are just freezing and won't come back unless explorer.exe process is ended. All open applications are also not accessible when this happends. It happends all the time and driving me and my clients crazy. Unfortunately I removed ClassicShell from all machines now until there is a fix. Both offices succesfully used ClassicShell on the clients with Windows7 and Windows 8.1. These same client machines were upgraded to Windows 10, and then ClassicShell the problems start.<br /><br />Situation on both offices: I use standard roaming profiles (loaded on logon from a profiles$ share) with folder redirection for the folders Documents, Video's, Pictures, Favorites, Contacts, Links. So, when a user logs on, the profile itself (startmenu etc.) is created (or read from share and created locally) on the client machine itself. So I cannot imagine that it has something to do with accessing the shared folder at any time during the right clicks.<br /><br />I am glad that I came across this forumpost to see that I am not the only one with this problem. Took me multiple hours to learn that it was Classicshell that created this problem.
