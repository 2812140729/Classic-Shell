		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Classic Shell 4.3.0 is officially supported on Windows 10 Anniversary Update.<br />Classic Shell 4.3.1 is officially supported on Windows 10 Creators Update.<br />Classic Shell 4.3.1 is reported by the majority to run on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, but some others are reporting various issues.<br /><br />It mostly works well on a clean install.....until the next Windows update/upgrade comes along to disrupt everything. As you may or may not be knowing, Classic Shell is no longer the priority for the developer (Ivo), nor for me (I was one of the testers). Windows 10 has caused me to lose interest in the PC platform completely.<br /><br />Classic Shell is in maintenance mode. New features and new releases will be very slow or unlikely. Issues with Windows 10 might be because of no testing performed by me on that OS. Even if you find issues, they must be reliably and consistently reproducible, only then can Ivo fix them. And that's the problem with Windows 10 - it gives everyone a very inconsistent experience.<br /><br />The community is of course free to carry the Classic Shell project forward and there are other decent Start menu solutions too.<br /><br />Because of the way Windows 10 is serviced and updated, it routinely creates crashing issues for Explorer because Microsoft's upgrade process is imperfect even after years of trying and cannot even properly migrate desktop app settings after the upgrade - it ends up deleting or corrupting certain configuration in the Registry required for Win32 programs to work properly. On a clean install of Windows 10's latest release, Classic Shell works. But often when in-place upgrades are done, Windows Setup damages it or causes serious issues due to their imperfect update process causing a partially installed state where Classic Shell crashes Explorer. I recommend you to stay with Windows 7 or 8.1 if you want to use Classic Shell.<br /><br />You could capture a crash dump as per these instructions: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopiccc99.html?f=12&amp;t=6">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=6</a><!-- l --> but there are so many instability issues in general with Windows 10 that it is always going to give you problems. It's not a good, well-engineered, well-tested system.<br /><br />Another thing you can try is download the Classic Shell Utility from here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../download1418.mediafire.com/gml27g7v03mg/3ukeryzw41qpfz8/ClassicShellUtility.exe">http://www.mediafire.com/download/3uker ... tility.exe</a><!-- m --> and use it to clean all traces of Classic Shell from your existing installation, including all settings. Then try a clean install of the newest version.<br /><br />However we cannot guarantee it won't crash or break again because Microsoft designed Windows 10 to routinely break desktop apps that integrate deeply with the system.<br />At present, there is an issue with Explorer hanging/freezing and crashing reported by a small group of users on Windows 10. The handle and thread count of Explorer process increases when the Start Menu is running.<br /><br />If you are doing an in-place build upgrade (not a clean install) and Windows removed Classic Shell for you, the fix that will most likely work is using the Utility to remove all traces of it including all settings for all users and then reinstall it. <strong>However, Windows 10 Setup also sometimes causes messed up Registry and file system permissions during the upgrade, causing Classic Shell to not work. Sometimes, the MSI installation data gets damaged or improperly migrated during the Windows 10 update. Some others have reported that changing the installation path from the default is causing it to crash. It is clear that Microsoft does not want non-Store desktop apps to survive for long.</strong><br /><br />Also, on some PCs which have IDT audio hardware, the audio driver (IDTNC64.cpl file to be specific) is known to be incompatible with the latest Windows 10. It can cause Explorer/Classic Shell to crash. Uninstall IDT audio driver or get the updated fixed one from HP's website for your PC model.<br /><br />Besides IDT, there is one more driver that has been reported to cause Explorer/Control Panel/Classic Start Menu crashes - Realtek's audio driver if you haven't updated it, contains RtkAPO.dll/RltkAPO64.dll which has the same effect as IDT's CPL file.<br /><br />The real &quot;fix&quot; is to not use Windows 10 at all since it is a very problematic OS that fails all quality control standards and never stops harassing the user via bloated forced updates. If you use it anyway, there is no incentive left for Microsoft to fix anything since they already have your support. They will continue to take you for granted and drop the ball on Windows quality even more. All Windows feedback falls on deaf ears and critical bugs and design flaws in the OS are never fixed as you may be knowing from experience.<br /><br />Use Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell if you want a more modern OS than Windows 7 without the hassles of Windows 10. You will be surprised at how well Windows 8.1 works once Classic Shell is installed to suppress the Metro UI.

We have been running Classic Shell 4.3 Start Menu only. <br />We have used build 1511 and 1607.  For some reason on 1607 and 1511 with updates if we have Classic Shell installed and let the computer sit for a while, windows explorer memory usage will creep up until the whole system hangs. The only way to resolve the issue is to open task manager and restart the process. I have been working with Microsoft to resolve the issue and they blame it on a Classic Shell dll file.<br /><br />I have read other articles that blame the issue on using the SSD drive with data somewhere else. However at home I have a Windows 10 with a SSD and 1 TB 7200 Drive and Classic Shell and experience no issues.  <br /><br />Im at a loss because we need to push out new computers and we cant.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been helping an elderly neighbor with their Win 10 system. Everything was working fine, including Classic Shell, until the Windows Anniversary &quot;update&quot; was installed a couple of days ago. As many others have reported, this &quot;update&quot; attempted to remove Classic Shell. Following the recommended &quot;fix&quot;, I used the Classic Shell Utility program to uninstall any leftover parts of the program (but did not delete the configuration settings). The reinstallation of the latest Classic Shell seemed to go fine, BUT now all the Win 10 Live Tiles are back and I cannot see any of the old pre-Anniversary desktop icons! Has anyone else see this behavior and/or have a suggestion as to how I can get rid to the unwanted tiles? Thanks, Wayne

Windows 10 will give you a lot of trouble.<br />1. It changes too much constantly which is a deal-breaker<br />2. Even regularly monthly updates are unreliable, slow, bloated. Large updates reset a ton of stuff and make the OS and many apps like Classic Shell fragile by breaking them or straightaway uninstalling them<br />3. The overall reduction in user control over many aspects of the system is very high in Windows 10

I suggest you learn how to format your drive, find device drivers for Windows 7/8.1 for your PC and install Classic Shell on Windows 7/8.1. Windows 10 is worse than malware. It's unintentionally or intentionally designed to hurt users. Nobody knows if Microsoft is just incredibly evil or incredibly stupid but it's better to stay away from such a toxic OS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Dear all, i just installed Creators update on 2 different computers, but they behaved similarly with Classic Shell:<br />- Classic Shell was still installed and initially all worked perfectly<br />- After about 10 minutes, the menù did not show me the list of frequently used applications (which was visible immediately after the update)<br />- if i switch to &quot;programs used recently&quot; a list of programs used even before the update comes immediately<br />- if i switch back to &quot;frequently used applications&quot; it stays empty.<br /><br />Obviously, if i repeatedly click on programs from the start menù-&gt;all programs, they will not appear in the list of frequently used applications anyway.<br /><br />Anybody is having the same issue?
