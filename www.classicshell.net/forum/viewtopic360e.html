However, I noticed a few thread titles suggesting the Anniversary Update may cause issues with Classic Shell. Should I have him uninstall it for the time being?

The hacked version that was circulating on Tuesday is another matter.<br /><br />Just make sure you have the genuine signed installer before you run it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't get mine to work. I had the earlier edition and when I did the ann update it no longer worked. I tried to uninstall it and re-install it. It would start and then say it is already there. I get the &quot;it was already installed&quot; and wouldn't go any further. I've tried going back to the windows prior version and I still get the same result. Could the windows explorer that it says needs to be closed be the problem? thanks g
