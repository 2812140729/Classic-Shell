		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In the Windows world, I would not be without Classic Shell.<br /><br />A couple of years ago, I was struggling with the total frustration of Windows Server 2012's start menu, and Classic Shell came to the rescue.  Within minutes of installing, I had my productivity -- and my sanity -- back! I could finally get back to work without the constant struggle.<br /><br />Fast forward to November 2015, and of course I just &quot;had&quot; to upgrade to Windows 10. Upgrade I did, and for the most part I like it. <br /><br /><strong>However </strong>the start menu again has turned out to be a stumbling block. Specifically, I searched and search to find a way to bring back the ever-so-useful &quot;Recent Items&quot; menu. I used the &quot;Recent Items&quot; menu many times a day in Windows 7.<br /><br />There seemed to be NO WAY to do it in Windows 10. Google search after Google search turned up <strong>nothing</strong>.<br /><br />Within seconds (literally) of installing Classic Shell on W10, voila! The old standby &quot;Recent Items&quot; is back, in all its glory. And as a huge bonus I got a Windows-7-like menu with a Windows 10 facelift -- all with every customization I could ever want.<br /><br />And yes, I donated. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Classic Shell. I hated Win8. Reinstalled 7 as soon as I tried it. But time marches on and 7 is being cast aside as XP was, So time to find a way to live with it. And frankly, what a POC. Every &quot;improvement&quot; they made, makes using windows more difficult. Wasting days to relearn what, by now, have been the basics. <br /><br />First, the lack of the Start menu was a paramount DeadFish for me. So, fighting through the resource hogging win update, I tried to get one. I tried some version of Start8 or the like, filled with extra junk it wanted to trick you into downloading, and topping the menu with add buttons. That in itself, maybe I could have hacked past, but it was a huge resource hog on its own.<br /><br />Whenever You click the start button, you wait, go get a coffee wait. I was born in 64, I DON'T GOT THAT KIND OF TIME. So, Luckily my second attempt, before deleting 8 again, Was ClassicShell's start menu. Perfect, fast and snappy, correct items and locations for me, easy to customize, NO EXTRAS!. Really, that's all I can ask for. <br /><br />Now the only question, since I opted no when I installed, how can I install the rest of ClassicShell app options without reinstalling my start menu.<br /><br />Huge kudos you all. well done.

Also, the author is a great person, answering my personal admin requests to get an account registered correctly. That's off his own time, too.

At the moment I have it set as Classic Style with Windows XP Luna skin. Goodbye clunky Windows 10 start menu. And I've donated! Its totally worth it.

I think that drugs that were being taken by designers/programmers during brainstorming that lead to that &quot;invention&quot; should be banned if it isn't already a case. And the thing in Windows 10 isn't much better. It's just not fullscreen.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am SO grateful for Classic Shell! I stumbled upon it right after Windows 10 automatically installed on my computer in August of 2015 and I was looking online for how to get back to Windows 7 (Restore would not work).<br /><br />Classic Shell works beautifully with Windows 10 that updated on my 2007 HP Pavilion tower/desktop  and I could not restore back to Windows 7 (yes, I tried everything). I know, 2007 is technically &quot;old&quot;, but I've done my own upgrades (more RAM, new hard drive, etc) over the years and this PC is working great, especially with Classic Shell!<br /><br />I'm not a &quot;gamer&quot; or anything like that. I do mostly Microsoft Office documents and machine embroidery digitizing, in addition to email/Internet, so this PC is fine for me (I have a &quot;back-up&quot; two year old AIO Vizio with Windows 8.1 if/when this HP bites the dust).<br /><br />Two days after Windows 10 updated I tried to restore Windows 7; Windows 10 said that the Windows.old file had been deleted...NO, it had not been. It was right where it should be (I've since  renamed the file so Windows 10 wouldn't do the automatic deletion 30 days later).<br /><br />...the other PCs/laptops in my household are still on Windows 7 &amp; 8.1...I did not allow them to go to Windows 10.<br /><br />Anyway, had it not been for Classic Shell, I surely would have lost my mind being stuck with Windows 10 on my primary PC. But thankfully, Classic Shell lets me see my old Windows Start Menu, etc. so I didn't have a complete mental meltdown. I continue to try to &quot;like&quot; Windows 10 but without Classic Shell, it just isn't going to happen.
