For example, if you open explorer window with some program up button missing, tree item spacing is default... When I open normal explorer everything is ok. I think the problem is that classic explorer settings has no effect on the explorer from folder SysWOW64 (32 bit folder in Windows 7 x64).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been using Classic Shell since Win8. I liked the Classic Explorer portion, but with the upgrade to Win10, the tree view is highly compressed &amp; unreadable, with the lines overlapping each other. I've tried several versions, but nothing works. I've had to uninstall the Classic Explorer portion &amp; just use the Classic Shell, which is fine, but I'd really like to have the Classic Explorer work like it used to.<br /><br />I've been unable to find a setting that has any effect. Any suggestions? Am I the only one with this problem? It's happening on all 5 of my computers now running Win10.<br /><br />I have Win10 Home &amp; Pro, 64bit, all laptops with 8GB RAM &amp; dual core of 1.8-2.2. I use FireFox as my default browser.

I used a cmd.exe with elevated privileges to run the program from the command line &amp; it ran fine. That is the most suggested workaround. The UAC, like many things in Win10, remains active &amp; has functionality even when completely disabled by an admin account. Only the 'hidden' Administrator can bypass it, which must be enabled before you can log in with it, which is not the recommended approach.<br /><br />I NEVER use IE. I use FireFox exclusively.<br /><br />You asked for before &amp; after screen shots. They're attached.

I didn't see any of the new information in your log. The new version is 637KB in size and the old version is 624KB. Which one do you have?<br /><br />The missing IE is not likely to be causing your problem. Well, if you installed it back and it fixed the problem, then what do I know <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Looks like you have some other extension that adds a toolbar and menu to Explorer. It may be interfering with Classic Shell.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks. I was using the one I downloaded before. I didn't think of the cert expiring. I'll try a new DL &amp; get you the new log.<br /><br />I don't have any other browser extensions installed. Everything listed is Classic Shell.<br /><br />I may try cleaning it out completely &amp; starting again from scratch. I did see the Classic Shell IE helper is listed as ClassicExolorer32.dll. Is that correct for a 64 bit Win10?<br /><br />I even tried the 4.2.5c version just made available &amp; it does the same thing.

And yes, 0 or 1 work equally well, though I am opting to use the value of 0, after all.
