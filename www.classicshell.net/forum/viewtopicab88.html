		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@TheCuza: the settings are stored in the registry, in the HKCU\Software\IvoSoft key. The uninstaller doesn't remove them because it doesn't have access to the user registry for all users. Also if it does, then your settings would be lost when you upgrade to a newer version. It doesn't hurt to leave them there, but if you want to you can delete that key. You can also reset all settings from the Backup button in the Classic Shell settings.<br /><br />@Clashelover49: The renaming was necessary for older version 4.1.0, which was blocked on Windows 10. And for good reason - it was not compatible <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> With 4.2.0 and later it is no longer necessary.<br /><br />@JStaats: What do you mean the shell is disabled? What is not working?

I cannot process anything using this latest beta. So I uninstalled 4.2.3 and installed 4.2.1. The classic shell menu is working again but I cannot get to the start screen. By the way, many thanks for a fantastic product. It makes w8 and w10 viable. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help!<br /><br />I just tried installing 4.2.2 and it works including support for Windows start, with no immediate issues. But just to reiterate, with 4.2.3, when I click the 'menu' window, the classic shell menu shows, windows explorer stops and the screen goes 'black', the classic shell menu disappears,  and windows explorer resumes.
