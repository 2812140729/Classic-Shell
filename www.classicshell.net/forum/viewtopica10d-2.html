There are 56 frames.<br /><br />Since the good folks at Stardock already did all the hard work,<br />I just used Pixel Former, to scale it down to half size.<br />Added a one pixel height to allow for the important pixel information line.<br />Constantly checked the instructions <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/tutorials/buttontutorial.html">http://www.classicshell.net/tutorials/b ... orial.html</a><!-- m --><br />and played with the color pixel numbers, until happy with the result.<br />Saved as .png file. <br /><br />Due to the wings flapping twice as high as taskbar,<br />I have mine on default button size, and &quot;Aligned to corner of screen&quot; checked.<br /><br /><br /><br />I have a strange sense of humour.<br />I'm briefly hovering the curser over dragon a couple times, until leaving in place.<br />Dragon looks like its A...A...ACHOO..ing. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

I looked up the Stardock Dragon theme video to check it out.. though very cool especially with the flames, they didn't use the dragon as a start button, but just as a decoration at the top of the start menu. I think what you did with the dragon is way cooler than stardocks use for it. Heck, the start button for that theme is simply a cheesy looking eye.<br /><br />Here's a link to that video so other folks can see the original dragon. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MiwLq8P88E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MiwLq8P88E</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'd Love to hear the dragon roar.. I wonder if there is a way to assign a wave file to the opening of the start button. Hmm..<br /><br />Ya know, though I searched high and low, I cannot find anymore animated buttons anywhere to use with Classic Shell.. which is odd to me because I know there was a program made for windows 7 that allowed you to make animated start buttons. I haven't tried it though. It works by converting animated gifs to start buttons.<br /><br />Windows 7 start button animator<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.door2windows.com/windows-7-start-button-animator-get-animated-start-button-in-windows-7/">http://www.door2windows.com/windows-7-s ... windows-7/</a><!-- m -->

You would have to make your own. <br /><br />I did try out what Ivo said about setting up a menu start up sound.<br />It works. I just used some old wave music opening file. It's not a dragon sound. <br />Maybe they only squeak like a mouse. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />Whatever a roar would sound like, after the fifth time the menu opens, a roar might be too much.<br />Sorry, I'm showing my age. OK, how about a dragon playing an electrified distorted power cord? Now I'm really showing my age. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />The eye button wasn't that bad to look at. I decided not to convert, as it's all horizontal frames.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I tried it with my own wav file also. It does work BUT, you see the animation before you hear the sound.. I'm telling the software to point the sound to &quot;Main Menu&quot; under Sound settings. <br /><br />What we'd really need for this is to have sound on mouseover so the sound plays as soon as you hover over the Dragon, the same time the animation plays. <br /><br />I cannot seem to find a way to do this in Windows even with third party apps. I know it can be done in Java but don't know how to make java work with windows. <br /><br />I can make my own html code website with all kinds of buttons and triggers and display that as a desktop in windows 10 using the software called WallPaperWebPage - <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Other-Desktop-Enhancements/WallpaperWebPage.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-En ... Page.shtml</a><!-- m --> but this is as close as I can get to the start button. I was hoping there would be something.. java or activeX or something that can solve this but I haven't found it yet.. I'll keep looking.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not worried about your age.. I'm a 48 year old heavy metal head banger child of the 80's myself LOL Your idea of an electric guitar riff sounds awesome. I had a heck of a time trying to find a free dragon roar that was 2 seconds or under.
