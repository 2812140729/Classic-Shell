It started back in 2009 as a simple weekend project and over time grew to be a hugely popular software brand with many millions of downloads. It was in large part due to all of you, the active Classic Shell community, that reported issues, suggested features, provided translations, developed new skins and participated in forum discussions. My thanks go to you for your continued support and encouragement.<br /><br />And of course, special thanks to <a href="viewtopic4edd.html?f=17&amp;t=8147&amp;p=34960#p34960" class="postlink">Gaurav Kale</a>, who stuck with me from the early days to the end. His passion for all things Windows was instrumental to the Classic Shell success.<br /><br />There were few factors that led to my decision:<br />1) Lack of free time. I have other hobbies that demand my time, some related to software and some not. It requires a lot of effort to add new major features to Classic Shell and keep it relevant. Even keeping it running on newer version of Windows is a lot of work. That leads me to point #2<br /><br />2) Windows 10 is being updated way too frequently (twice a year) and each new version changes something that breaks Classic Shell. And<br /><br />3) Each new version of Windows moves further away from the classic Win32 programming model, which allowed room for a lot of tinkering. The new ways things are done make it very difficult to achieve the same customizations<br /><br />So, moving forward, I am making the latest version of Classic Shell open-source and adding it back to SourceForge (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/classicshell/</a><!-- m -->), where it all began. I encourage other people to fork it and go with it.<br />I will keep the MediaFire download mirror for another 6 months. The forum on <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="index.html">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/</a><!-- m --> will stay open until the end of 2018, however I will not frequently participate in the discussions.<br /><br />Update: The source code can be also found on GitHub here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/coddec/Classic-Shell">https://github.com/coddec/Classic-Shell</a><!-- m -->

This would be useful if you wanted the community to take over maintaining Classic Shell and keeping it unbroken on future Windows releases in the original repository, as opposed to a &quot;Classic Shell Community&quot; fork or something similar.

I'll keep logs from SourceForge there too, in case SourceForge goes the way of Codeplex.<br /><br />The other advantage of this is that my infrastructure can perform on-the-fly checksum matching. Should a breach occur like the Classic Shell/Audacity breach of 2016, I can automatically notify developers. After going open source, this will be a whole lot more important.<br /><br />Naturally, in the spirit of FOSS I will do this free of charge, permanently.

I have had a well-paying job in game development for years, even before Classic Shell started. The main goal was to have fun coding, to create a tool mostly for my own use (at least initially), and afterwards to support the awesome community that formed around Classic Shell.<br /><br />Thanks, thx_4_the_hard_wk, for the GitHub upload. I do not need it to be under my name, since I don't have an account there. I will add the GitHub link to the FAQ page when I get the chance.<br />I would like nothing more than somebody else picking up the mantle and continue the development.

I use it on Windows 7 for the extras, like Classic IE, but would you believe I also use Classic Shell's Start Menu (in Windows 7 skin) on Windows 7? That's right, I use Classic Shell instead of the native menu even tho they look identical - Turned out there is a bug with Kaspersky and the Start Menu that does not happen when using Classic Shell. The day I switched from the native menu to Classic Shell's, I donated; it was worth every penny I gave. Dearly hope someone else picks-up maintenance. I agree that Microsoft is making everyone's job a major pain in the behind with their ridiculous re-compile of the entire OS every 6 months; everything breaks! And for what? So that Windows looks and feels and programs like a smartphone! Better stop here or I will rant all night...

I understand you reasons really well.<br /><br />I used Windows 10 only a couple of days until now.<br />The first to install it (the last day which it was &quot;free&quot;, last year).<br />The last to update to FCU.<br />In the meanwhile to disable and change to my liking what is still possible to tweak.<br />I had no problem at all, but I really dislike what Microsoft is doing.<br /><br />I still use Windows 7 Pro, and, if this is the trend with every &quot;new&quot; update, I'll have to find another OS, maybe Linux, who knows...<br /><br />Thanks Ivo for all, anyway.

Because I have looked at other start menu options but the other software is not as good as Classic Shell.<br />Classic Shell is very much like the Windows XP and 7 start menu but other software is not quite the same.<br /><br />So I am staying with Classic Shell no matter what.

For many years it was my go-to for anything that had Windows 8.x or newer on it. Heck, once my parents upgraded their computers to Windows 10, I set them up with it, and they loved it too.<br /><br />Beyond even that, your product inspired me. Classic Shell was pretty much my introduction to the very idea that the Windows operating system can be modified, and my entry point to taking part in such Customizations. Eventually it even inspired me to start developing my own menu, which is kind of exploding into something bigger now, but I won't get too far into that here.<br /><br />Thank you for what you've done for all of us for all these years. Your efforts and source code won't go to waste, that's for sure. I promise.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">freezer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Thanks for the great program and hopefully this project will live on in some form or another.</div><br /><div class="quotetitle">Pierrot wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">No classic shell = no Windows 10, or 8.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello. I am a huge Windows enthusiast since the earliest releases of Windows, and did Classic Shell's testing and usability/UX feedback. Why Classic Shell's development is ending in short is Microsoft has turned hostile towards their own &quot;legacy&quot; customers to grow their business further and that has made developing Win32 apps on it that closely integrate with the OS a nightmare and even using the OS is a nightmare. Windows 10 is an unacceptable monstrosity the way it is currently designed. How dare they design an atrocious OS like this and how dare you use it while neglecting its serious flaws but expecting third parties to fix it for free for you! <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />Windows 10 has been the biggest disappointment ever because Microsoft has turned a deaf ear towards most of their user base and is completely disrespecting and ignoring what they are asking for. No one ever asked for Windows-as-a-Service delivering constant huge updates that disrupt your carefully tuned set-up.<br /><br />Classic Shell has been fixing and enhancing Windows since <strong>Nov. 2009</strong> but Microsoft has moved away from Win32 programs and towards UWP. They have also moved away from Windows as a product to a service that is a tremendous bandwidth burden on everyone. <strong><em>The frequency and size of updates is a joke and a huge disruption to an existing system on which Windows has been installed and carefully fine-tuned.</em></strong> It is pointless to even try to improve an OS when its own developer is making things worse and less customizable and so disruptive as part of their planned obsolescence. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Microsoft is no longer maintaining proper continuity of features in new releases of Windows. They are just arbitrarily adding new features without even considering how bloated and *seriously unproductive* their updates have become.</strong></span></em><br /><br />If the nature of Windows changes in the future from a service, back to a product, that doesn't bombard you with tremendously bloated, intrusive, disruptive, rude, worthless updates that leave you with no real control, and if it gives you sufficient freedom to tweak or keep the features <em>you</em> like, <em>and</em> if any fork of Classic Shell happens from the code released on SourceForge/GitHub, then I am definitely interested in testing it again. However at the moment, Windows 10 is such a nightmare that it makes no sense to develop a quality app for it. Even if some other developer takes up the Classic Shell project, it just doesn't improve the horrible Windows experience in any way. Out-of-control bloat-filled updates make the OS waste your bandwidth, storage space and time continuously and are an epic pain to deal with. It is highly unlikely that Windows will get any better unless the management changes at Microsoft to focus on the quality of the user experience.<br /><br />For 10 years since Windows Vista, Microsoft has been unable to develop a decent servicing mechanism for Windows. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> On top of that, the quality of code and features delivered by updates is very poor. And that is just the tip of the ice berg. There are so many problems with Windows 10 under the new management that I can't even begin to list them. But despite horrible flaws, only a small subset of its users seem to care and the rest are accepting anything that Microsoft offers them. It doesn't make any sense to build an <em>intelligent productivity-focused </em>free app like Classic Shell with so much effort and attention to detail if the majority doesn't care about productivity and if the UX is such a nightmare for us. You can choose to stay with Windows 7 or 8.1 where it should continue to work for years. Right now, Microsoft keep on adding new features but breaking old ones - so they're only going around in circles. When Microsoft brings back Windows to a reasonable level of productivity, usability, and solid, steady improvements (not &quot;improvements&quot; that slap you in the face and abandon all previous innovations) then it might be worthwhile to make something like Classic Shell for it.<br /><br />Until then, adios.

But not everyone. There's not enough time and resources to convince everyone in the world how crap it is. Most people don't care as long as it does <em>their</em> tasks like Facebook and email and games, while some are of the opinion that they must obey/comply with any change that Microsoft does because they blindly trust Microsoft to always take the best decision for them. So even if the Windows team might be full of incompetent or dishonest people, it makes no difference to the company's bottom line. They have worked with PC manufacturers and their partners to eradicate Windows 7 and 8.1 from the market. For example, without the necessary drivers, you won't be able to properly run Windows 7 or 8.1 on newer hardware. Without Windows Update supported officially on newer CPUs (which it isn't), it won't be patched or updated. Microsoft can force Windows 10 as long as people tolerate their nonsense. But it looks like a lot of people are not tolerating their nonsense which is why PC sales are down for so long. There are ways to do many tasks without a PC (mobile devices) and that's exactly what people are choosing.

This concern very few people, mostly in video processing/encoding, but, this could be a reason to upgrade. To have access to theses features if the your program support them, you'll have to be under Windows 10.<br />As the &quot;why&quot; Windows 7 for exemple doesn't support them ? Just because they didn't exist at the time. Principal issue is multi-tasking and context saving, the OS can't save/restore registers he doesn't even know they exist.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Classic Shell was the only way Windows 7 and above were usable by me.<br /><br />I've been using the classic start menu, status bar and every &quot;classic&quot; feature since I got into PCs.  It's my workflow, I've been doing it for 2 decades now.<br /><br />XP changed the start menu, kept classic features from 95/98 though; no problem.<br />Vista changed the UI, explorer, a lot.. but kept classic features.<br />Windows 7?  Despite the pointless UI change (beta taskbar, horrendous 'painting' lag), it removed all &quot;classic&quot; feature support, despite being extremely similar to Vista (which even got DX11 support that W7 had).  It was at that point using Windows became a nightmare, and I stayed on Vista for many many years.  Applications started breaking, then Intel dropped support for it, forcing me to upgrade to 7 to even use newer PC hardware.<br />8?  8 changed so much I didn't even bother with it.  I had to fix a laptop with it and Windows 8 made me want to smash it to bits.<br /><br />And now Windows 10..  the apparent 'final' version of windows.  The version they forced on everyone even though they didn't want it.  So many atrocities committed, so much underhandedness.  And still full, full, full of issues.  Even the FCU is full of issues and I was forced to just rollback, then W10 decided to auto-update right after and break the whole damn thing.<br /><br />Windows 10 is garbage, yet we're being forced to use it to stay up to date with hardware/software.  W10's exclusive DirectX12 will become mainstream, open platform Vulkan will sit by the wayside; if you game, you'll be forced to use W10.  If you upgrade your hardware, Intel/NVIDIA/AMD will eventually force you to use W10.  I've already been forced into using 10 due to compatibility/performance issues with 7.<br /><br />For the people who can switch to something like Linux, it's alright with them.  For the vast majority who can't.. we're forced into using 10 whether we like it or not.<br /><br />I dread the day when classic shell truly stops working.<br /><br />Thank you for the years of development.<br /><br />And thank you releasing the source code. I only question if it's too late..

I'm definitely gonna miss this if no one else picks up the torch. I don't have the tech skills <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Thank you for all you put into this project and good luck with whatever you do next.
