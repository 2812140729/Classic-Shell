Notice; absolutely there are definitely things in windows 8 that this, or any other known program cover up<br /><br />as for the start button itself.. it should be close.. but there are still slight differences lack of blur, buttons not perfectly aligned, and a context menu on right clicking the button for example<br /><br />Try it out though, and you should be pleasantly surprised <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />you can try it on windows 7 if you want to get a jumpstart on messing around (if your the type to). Or classic shell has a quick way to jump to the windows 7 style if you don't feel like customizing it<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Fri Dec 26, 2014 9:45 pm</p><hr />

We wanted to get my dad a laptop for christmas, he's quite used to windows 7, but the one laptop best buy had available with win7 was not in stock and I wanted to set it up for him before he drives back to saskatchewan.<br /><br />Best Buy offered to set up classic shell for us, and that seemed the easiest option, I find myself a bit anxious though, hopefully with some research I will be able to give him something that will be indistinguishable from his preferred windows 7 experience. If not I will have to purchase a copy of win7 from memory express and just hope that the dell laptop we got will accept a &quot;down&quot;grade.<br /><br />I'm not anticipating a problem, but I have been avoiding windows 8 like the plague after it made me feel useless, maybe I'm even more of a curmudgeon than my dad.<br /><br />Mostly he hoards his ripped video and music files, and stores them on dozens of external drives, so from what I've learned about classic shell, he shouldn't notice, but until I get the computer tomorrow and dig in for myself, I'll have to twiddle my thumbs and hope a few online guides will make my dad's christmas for me.<br /><br />Maybe the thread title should be added to the faq? <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=6583">Holythirteen</a> — Fri Dec 26, 2014 3:34 pm</p><hr />
