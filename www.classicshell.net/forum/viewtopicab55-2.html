Not exact match, but close enough for the retro feel. <br /><br />It has the qty 31 color variations, with the color title bar/ band at top of menu.<br />It has the older single classic menu, with the gradient caption bar on left, <br />as well as a hybrid single menu, with bar on top.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> This is a very large 3 MB file. <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> It is basically 3 variations,(caption single, single, two column),<br />times 30, which is 90 total. Yes, the high contrast types are somewhat redundant, only added 50KB though. <br />I shrunk bitmaps, where I could. <br />Still, qty 164 picture bitmaps. A whole lota menu. <br />Whew, glad I can now put this menu to bed.<br /><br />Tried with CSM 4.1.0 on Win7/8.1 Works best in Win8.1 The 3d border is built into bitmap. <br />Not compatible with most older versions of CSM. Will only partially work.<br /><br />After downloading file, paste in skins folder. Usually C:\Program Files\Classic Shell\Skins<br />Exit CSM, restart CSM, and go to &quot;Start Menu Style&quot; tab. Pick &quot;Classic style&quot;<br />or &quot;Classic with two columns&quot;.<br />Pick &quot;XP Classic Retro&quot; in Skin tab. <br /><br /><br />ps The menu is standalone. Does not change taskbar/windows border color.<br />I threw in some experimental color bar menus at the end of the list.<br />If you want the op system caption blank, or replaced with personal words, alter in the &quot;menu look&quot; tab of CSM.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Edit: </span><br />Removed original skin with bad spelling.<br />Moved style 7 and Classic style 1/2 rev C skins, zipped to this post, for fast download speed. <br />Rev B still in other original post location.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Edit:</span> Added request for plain menu Classic 2 column.<br /><br /><span style="color:#ff0000;">Edit: </span><span style="color:#333333;">Upgraded 7 style version to revision B.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Different icon size for each column is not possible. Since the right side column icons don't change that frequently, you can make them smaller than what size you have set for the left by finding icons that have the size you want (like 24x24) and padding them with transparent pixels to the full icon size (32x32). That is, basically, use smaller, 24x 24 size images inside 32x32 size. Then set the new icons from the Customize tab <br /><br />You can also edit the Luna skin to reduce the icon padding in the second column. You can even use negative padding (Main2_icon_padding=4,-4,4,-4). <br /><br />I don't know of a way though to make second column icons bigger and left column icons smaller.

They make it look so rich. The effort you put into making skins is remarkable. <br /><br />I know &quot;Classic&quot; isn't white, but can I make a request to add a &quot;White menus&quot; checkbox option so the main menu and submenu are white? The &quot;Windows 8&quot;, &quot;Windows Aero&quot; skins have this option.

Brown shoes, brown pants, brown shirt, dulls the senses.<br />Need a white shirt for the business part of it. I will add as an option. It will still retain the 3d colored border and separators.<br />That is easy. It will use one tiny bitmap green mask to get the bleached white look, for the 23 original variations. <br /><br />As for the main menu, If I make them all white, it takes away from the original battleship grey look <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /> <br />They will, look sharper, hygienic, and newer looking. <br />But I don't know. The &quot;rainy day&quot; wouldn't be the same if sun glasses are required. Tropic night would look lit up with 10 arc lamps <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Maybe we could have a compromise. I will put option for white main/submenus only for the original 23 variations. <br />This will require 3 more larger bitmap green masks. Ha ha, the file keeps getting bigger.<br /><br />As for the other 8, they are more complicated, with separate set of up to four bitmap masks for each variation required.<br />Some won't look good. For those ones, I will leave as is, or just make a white submenu. <br /><br />Is that ok?<br />Also, this may take a while. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I found a way to use it without an Aero theme: Change the &quot;over-ride glass color&quot; setting to what the color of your theme is. The only problem is you can't change the menu color separate from the caption color, but I didn't even ask for that feature, so I can't complain. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> But I have to ask: Where did Tropic Morning/Night come from? They look good though. I attached the log off and shut down buttons that XP uses for them (In a .zip, since .ico s aren't allowed for some reason. Can you allow them Ivo?)

So blinded by the white 255 it is <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" />. <br /><br />I have finished qty 20 variations so far. The rest will take longer, <br />as they don't reference much from the first variation skin folder. <br /><br />Hello Weboh.<br /> I always see tropic sea horizons in glass buttons. <br />Hence the name, and they are colored bars that fit the gradient bar theme.<br />Made them from looking at web sites, on how to make simple glass buttons.  <br />I use Pixelformer to make the round corners, some of the gradients, and of course,<br />adjust the alpha layer. If you want to put the tropic buttons in other menus, <br />I did not make them transparent like Ivo's. That can be good and bad. <br />Good in that they can be on white or black backgrounds. Bad as no see through blending. <br />You can change the alpha layer transparency easily, with Pixelformer.<br /><br />Gotta go. It's 4:15 in the morning Bye

There's so many variations, it's hard to find the right one. Or if you're really feeling ambitious, you could make the menu color and font color selectable as well in one variation. (I use modified Windows 98 Plus! Themes, and it'd be nice to have a&quot;Plus!&quot; menu that I could make go with it.) I'm fine with me needing some setup to make it work, similar to your Luna BBT theme. But I know how much wok it was to do all you've done, and it's all I originally asked for. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I will have to devise a method to put it back properly for all:( <br /><br /><br /><br />I put the variations same as in the original list, reading bottom to top. I could put them in order, except the first skin variation &quot;Windows standard&quot;. <br />From what Ivo informed me way back, can't have options in variations. It could be possible as general options. It really starts getting too much for that in a menu skin this size. The logic drives me bonkers, when everything is just one long script.<br /><br />Sorry, I want to put this menu to bed. It keeps waking up. Will have to give it a sleeping pill for Zzzz, not revision Z<br /><br />Later, probably next week, will come back again, for update.

Once I click on it, it goes back to single dot. Then all is well.<br /><br />For this skin, they froze up for many hours.<br />I am kind of sloppy making scripts. If it doesn't work, I tend to put more copies of text to make it work.<br />I could be the problem <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> <br /><br />Thank you very much for taking time to look at it.<br /><br /><br />Edit: I put the rev C skin on first post.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Now that you mentioned off white (240) and having actually used the Rev C skin, I agree that white for both columns can be blinding. Maybe one column white and the other colored with the original, off-white or original+white/black mixed to give pleasant, readable shade would achieve perfection in the look. The Aqua variation already does it and it looks lovely. <br /><br />But I don't want you to spend more time on it unless you really want to, so even if rev C is the final revision, it's OK. We could always mod the skin ourselves. <br /><br />I am also willing to donate you some amount for putting effort into making a nice skin. Can you privately PM me your PayPal?

It happens for the &quot;Submenu color&quot; radio group. <br /><br />Your sample screenshot looks good. Personally I think 255 white in left column and a shade closer to the title bar for right column (but which keeps the text readable) will look outstanding. Take your time to make the skins, there's no rush or deadline.

I think it could use that color plus internal menu color.<br />Difficult to work properly for darkening, as user would need to do it. <br />Could not find a way for it to work in Win8.1 at all. <br />Hoping there is a simple way to get what you want. Any ideas?<br /><br />If each of the original bitmaps require replacing with tweaked one, it will become a long project indeed. <br />I will have to abandon it at that stage.<br /><br />Hey. Just changing the subject a little. Upon experimenting for you, I found what I was looking for, way back.<br />So it <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> possible, to have a selector short circuit, and cut through the menu.<br />Take a look at the picture of one.

You guys are the Gods.<br /><br />I have a hard enough time remembering what I did the day before.<br />My brainwash sleep not only washed away the toxins, but also most of my memories.<br />I'm more a Born Again Skinner. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The skin revisions kind of fizzeled out. <br />From what I remember there was a problem with the green mask not working, and random temporary stuck radio buttons.<br />To be 240/255 white, and also to have split 240/255 white on left, and original on right.<br />I wasn't sure what you wanted with the white. To make white 255/255 on left is easy with just one green mask referenced to white. <br />To darken the right at same time, another set of every tailor made bitmaps would need to be made. <br />It would be huge amount of work. Skin had around 200 bitmaps, and would get even bigger! <br />Was busy, and I kind of got disenterested at that time. Maybe a green/blue combo mask in future might reduce bitmap qty?<br />I put skin on the back burner. It's on one of my drives somewhere.<br /><br />Time has passed.<br />Ivo came out with an updated CSM version fix for the green mask, to fix the white option. The radio buttons, I think just needed skin to be reset. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, so now you would like it all converted to Win 7 style.<br />Now all the questions.<br /><br />1. Is it ok to just convert the rev B (without white option), or do you want rev C (the full white option), or never finished rev D (split white)?<br /><br />2. Do you want the inside programs background always white, or same color as Mainleft?<br /><br />3. The picture frame will have to sit in middle of right column on the bar. It might look funny when other bigger icons show.<br />Do you want it a bigger frame sticking out of menu, or inside below gradient bar, or original on bar?<br /><br />4. Do you want me to just include the original colors, and leave the other custom ones for another separate skin in future? <br /><br />5. Do you want the gradient bar on the jump, and search menus?<br /><br />6. Do you want the old search box (easy), or a 3d version (possibly lots of work for each color, or might be easier if most of it invisble)? <br /><br />7. Can the search bitmap be regular, or should I try and duplicate the blue magnifier button in screen shot?<br /><br />8. Do you even want the gradient title bar at top, or just the solid colors, like in the menu screenshot? <br /><br />Whatever the answers,<br />this is going to be a big, big project, and take some weekends to do it.

Its likely (I havnt checked to confirm) that their skins don't use system color, but instead rely on hard-coded color variations to get everything 'perfect' Then even throwing in a feature like &quot;Make the left column white&quot; doubles the number of bitmaps in-use because each variation needs a white-left version. Throw in another similar option (like 'reserve space for shutdown') and that number doubles again, because all the bitmaps need a version that supports that extra space, and a version that supports that extra space AND white left column

You can have as many variations as you want without adding bitmaps.<br /><br />In the simplest case you can even replace the bitmap with a solid color, so all you need is a single mask bitmap. Let's say you have a mask that is square with 4 quadrants - black, red, green, and blue. You can control what color goes into each quadrant:<br />Main_bitmap_mask=11 - the mask bitmap<br />Main_bitmap=#123456 - first color (goes into the black areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint1=#56789A - second color (goes into the red areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint2=#ABCDEF - third color (goes into the green areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint3=#FEDCBA - fourth color (goes into the blue areas of the mask)<br /><br />The alpha channel of the mask bitmap can be used to provide transparency.<br /><br />Take a look at the Metro skin. It makes heavy use of this trick to combine the Windows colors into multiple shapes.

After all, the creation of a skin with so many variations is hard work. PM me your PayPal if you have one. Btw, if it encourages you, Ivo has fixed the &quot;stuck radio buttons&quot; bug for the next version of Classic Shell.</strong><br /><em><br />1. Is it ok to just convert the rev B (without white option), or do you want rev C (the full white option), or never finished rev D (split white)?</em><br /><strong>Only Rev B will do. In fact, a simple global &quot;White submenus&quot; checkbox option will do for me. I don't need left or right columns of the main menu to be white.</strong><br /><br /><em>2. Do you want the inside programs background always white, or same color as Mainleft?</em><br /><strong>Inside programs background always white.</strong><br /><br /><em>3. The picture frame will have to sit in middle of right column on the bar. It might look funny when other bigger icons show.</em><br /><em>Do you want it a bigger frame sticking out of menu, or inside below gradient bar, or original on bar?</em><br /><strong>User picture frame not sticking out or inside below but on the gradient bar. The icons are 64 x 64 so I guess the gradient bar can be made 64 pixels taller?</strong><br /><br /><em>4. Do you want me to just include the original colors, and leave the other custom ones for another separate skin in future? </em><br /><strong>All the colors!</strong><br /><br /><em>5. Do you want the gradient bar on the jump, and search menus?</em><br /><strong>Yes.</strong><br /><br /><em>6. Do you want the old search box (easy), or a 3d version (possibly lots of work for each color, or might be easier if most of it invisble)?</em><br /><strong>Old search box.</strong><br /><br /><em>7. Can the search bitmap be regular, or should I try and duplicate the blue magnifier button in screen shot?</em><br /><strong>Regular search bitmap will do.</strong><br /><br /><em>8. Do you even want the gradient title bar at top, or just the solid colors, like in the menu screenshot?</em><br /><strong>Yes, gradient title bar is the killer feature of this magnificent skin.</strong>

There are too many colors on the main bitmaps for using tint masks.<br />I think I'm going to use the original main bitmaps without tints.<br /><br />So, I'm going to rule out the double height gradient title bar for picture second column icons. <br />The file size would get even bigger, and there would be a lot of dead gradient space.<br />Was even thinking of burning the lower full width horizontal original separator into the main bitmap, <br />but that would double the main bitmap size as well, so that would be 3 times as big for each.<br /><br />That would be good for just a single standard classic XP menu skin, not 31 variations. <br /><br />I am definitely going to use tint masks for all the separators, and most of the submenus, as there are fewer colors.<br />This will take time sampling all the colors, and putting tint color text in. <br />It's easier putting in the ones made up already, but then I would not learn anything new. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I will have inside programs pane white except for &quot;Tropic Night&quot; variation. <br /><br />Will let you know in another week, how many steps further I got, and reverts.
