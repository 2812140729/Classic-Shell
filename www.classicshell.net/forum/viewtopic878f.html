My antivirus software has blocked me from going there because the web page &quot;Contains malware and exploits&quot;. I wonder which anti-virus you are using. Mine is Panda (Free).<br /><br />You say: &quot;Maybe it bundles something else&quot;. Or maybe the anti-malware products decide that anything changing certain entries of the registry must automatically be bad, without actually bothering to determine why those entries are being changed.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That site is safe, at least that page definitely is. Your antivirus program is incorrect. <br /><br />When you use that tweak from Folder Options X, it forces Explorer to use the older view control (of Vista and XP) instead of the newer control introduced in Windows 7. The differences are not that major. The spacing between items in less in the older control so the items appear closer but one major annoyance is when you switch to the List View in Windows Explorer, it actually turns on full row selection there, whereas in the newer control, full row selection is off for Explorer List View but on for Details view. So the older control used in Vista makes it very annoying and hard to select multiple files and folders in List View by drag-selecting them from the blank space.

(Without much like, I must add).<br /><br />Anyway, I installed Folder Options X and it works perfectly. I don't see that &quot;major annoyance&quot; in the List View of Windows Explorer and have no problems selecting multiple files.<br /><br />Did you try it in Windows 10 or were the problems you listed in an earlier Windows version?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Windows 10 Creators Update has re-introduced this Vista-like behavior for List View of File Explorer. The improvement done in Windows 7 to make selection easier like XP has been destroyed. Now the entire row is selected in List View making it really hard to select files. If a file is already selected and you start dragging from an empty area to select more files, it interprets it as drag and drop. Also, de-selecting all files (select none) becomes more difficult.
