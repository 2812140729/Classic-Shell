It can be removed by donating $5 USD to BigMuscle via the website but that's practically all that gets effected.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">Nimbi</a> — Fri Jul 22, 2016 2:54 pm</p><hr />

I'm noticing your first post in this thread is doing that, but the screenshot appears to be the cause.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">Nimbi</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2016 4:21 pm</p><hr />

You can try the current Beta version of Classic Shell. You can use taskbar images with it to get the border. Sadly the icon backgrounds can't be regained in Windows 10, but Classic Shell's beta can be used to get Windows 7-like taskbars via static images. As for the aero blur, that can be gained via the AeroGlassGUI tool downloaded via glass8.eu but you'll need the AeroGlass mod for that. You can get that from glass8.eu as well. Just be careful which one you get. The one for 8.1+ works on Windows 8.1 to 10 v1511.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">Nimbi</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2016 10:05 am</p><hr />

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Adjusting the taskbar appearance in Win 10]]></title>

Just went from Win 8.1 to Win 10 last night and got an unpleasant surprise with the latter's limited display color settings, compared to earlier versions of Windows where one can adjust intensity, saturation, hue and brightness. So I've been playing with Classic Shell's settings for the taskbar. But the latter appears to present something of a catch-22: low or no opaqueness eliminates the top border, while increasing opaquness lacks the contrast I had with previous versions of Windows. Is that (seeming) border in the earlier Windows something the OS controls or could Classic Shell conceivably add it? I've attached a screenshot of the taskbar on my Win 7 laptop, the same display settings I also used in Win 8 (didn't touch CS's settings in Win 8 as I recall).<br /><br />P.S. Not sure why, but this forum is not scaling to the browser window on the posts screen; i.e., In Opera 12, IE11 and FF4x, when I save this and see the post, it's like the text is magnified to 150% or so, with a scroll bar added down below. Even the forums list text seems magnified, tho it does fit in the browser window. With Opera 39, the text is as small as I'm seeing right now typing, but the page still isn't scaling to the browser window.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1532">highstream</a> — Thu Jul 21, 2016 8:39 am</p><hr />
