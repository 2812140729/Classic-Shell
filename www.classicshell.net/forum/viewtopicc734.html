Thorsten <span style="font-family:Segoe UI, sans-serif;"></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><span class="posthilit">Reviews</span> from other websites (CNET, Softpedia etc):</span> <br /><br />basilirwin <br />Classic Shell is an awesome program. I much prefer it to the Vista and Windows 7 Start Menus. It's tremendously customizable and you can export and import all the settings so that they can be applied to other computers and login ids. It also provides a great replacement for XP-style function buttons on Windows Explorer. Again, customizable and one can export and import settings. I use its Classic Explorer function to hook to a good third party filesystem search program to replace the excrable Vista/W7/W8 filesystem search. <br /><br />But the best thing is that Classic Shell 3.5 puts its beautiful Start Menu on Windows 8 Consumer Preview, turning a sow's ear into a silk purse! Settings from W7 will even import into W8, providing instant customization. <br /><br /><br />Lord_Glorfindel <br />Best Start Menu alternative I've Found. Works flawlessly with much flexibility and options. <br /><br /><br />ianhudson1 <br />Compensated for Microsoft's blunders. Software provides any one (or all) of a wide range of xp-related functions (personally used the 'up a level' button). Windows really should have come with these functions built in...Would highly recommend to anyone who misses the xp features this program provides. <br /><br /><br />Malchak <br />Makes the Windows 7 Start Menu Customizable to your needs. It looks much cleaner. Increases efficiency as well as making your desktop shortcuts unnecessary giving you a cleaner desktop. I highly recommend this software. Nothing out there right now can compete in ease of use and effectively solving your problems with the current Windows Start Menus. It's easily customizable to have everything you need at the click of an icon. <br /><br /><br />billearl <br />Makes Windows 7 (and Vista) MUCH more usable! Extremely useful, rock solid and well supported. Amazing (and free) software! Highly recommended. <br /><br /><br />Klatuu <br />If your computer use is about getting things done rather than glitz, Windows 7 can disappoint. But by turning off the Aero and other effects and installing Classic Shell, Windows will be faster and more responsive, and you will once again have a Menu that allows you to organize things they way you want. Program works great - highly recommended for serious computing. <br /><br />John Tesla <br /><br />Essential core software. Of all the software, what is more essential and &quot;core&quot; than the Windows explorer interface and the start menu, and task bar controls? Classic Shell allows you far more control and options for this than any product I've seen; it is free and runs without problem on more than 10 computers (family, friends etc), and lets me/other users make the Windows interface the way I want, not as Microsoft would force on me. Fabulous!If you hate the Win7 setup and want to revert back to XP - or any other custom setup - this is what you need. Crucial when upgrading or installing a new system. I can't praise it enough. <br /><br /><br />jhc1115 <br />Good news for Win7 users. This quick download will put you right in the driver's seat on screen.You soon realize the quick responsive choice menu of familiar XP is at hand.&quot;Classic Shell&quot; provides an escape from the bloated menu Win 7 offers even in it's most basic personalization. A good mix of past control but new OS dynamic. <br /><br /><br />Pcs800 <br />When windows 7 came out I was beside myself at the fact that MS omitted the classic menu style. The way I arrange my menu simply cannot be accommodated with the overly compact new style. Being unable to get classic buttons like delete, etc. Onto the explorer toolbar was annoying too. This program took care of everything. If you've got vista or 7, you need this. <br /><br /><br />Gorlash <br />The Champion of the Start Menu replacements!! A magnificent program, beautiful with any of the skins, thoroughly configurable. It even works with Windows 8 (where it is even MORE desperately needed!). Highly recommended. Don't pay for a Start Menu program until you've tried this one! You'll never go back... <br /><br /><br />Shodan816 <br />I have been using 'Classic Start Menu' by Ordinarysoft fot the past several years - until I recently discovered 'Classic Shell.' This utility is superior to Classic Shell in virtually every aspect and adds numerous features for tweaking Windows Explorer and IE9 on top of that. You have nothing to lose by giving it a try. You will love it. <br /><br /><br />cowidster <br />I have use this for a long time, now I write this to say thanks! It is simply perfect! Thank you very much for the creator of this software, I really appreciate it. <br /><br /><br />Sylvia <br />Excellent program! I didn't like that I had to click to access my programs. Now everything is a lot more accessible. Thanks! <br /><br /><br />Lee <br />So happy to get no frills clasic look using windows 7. Sometimes Microsoft changes thing that do not need to be changed. <br /><br /><br />Raargh <br />I cannot properly express my thanks for Classic Shell in words - I want to use $. Do you have PayPal? Please keep up the good work.</div>
