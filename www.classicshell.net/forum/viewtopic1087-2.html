		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I suspect this is a bug since CSM fails with the default settings. I am running Classic Start Menu version 4.3.0 on W10 x64 Pro (W10.1607.15002.1001) under Hyper-V. The Shutdown dialog is not displayed and if I add all the individual items in the pull down, only Disconnect, Logoff, Lock and Switch User are displayed. I tried many different things and I cannot get the Shut Down type commands to show. It seems to be related to the Group Policy &quot;Remove and prevent access to Shut Down, Restart, Sleep and Hibernate commands.&quot; By enabling this policy, W10 normal Start menu does very similar. Please let me know if there is a work around via the Registry or Group Policy. Thanks and enjoy, John.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks much, <strong>Gaurav </strong>for your reply. I cannot find your setting and even Google has not heard of it. I am looking in my VM machine and assume that is what you wanted me to do but did not say. When using the W10 start menu all of these settings are available. The VM I am running is Hyper-V provided my MS and it has many features not normally available. I have also looked through Group Policies but was able to find nothing. Further help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and enjoy, John.

I was looking for the setting in the W10 Settings not the CSM settings. Thanks much for your help. Enjoy, John.

In order to restart or shut down I have to Ctrl-Alt-Delete and that is annoying. This most likely happened due to an MS update which unfortunately I have no control over now with Windows 10. Any suggestions on how to fix this?  <br />P.S. System Restore is also not working since that day because I tried to do a restore several times that day and since but it fails every time. Thanks
