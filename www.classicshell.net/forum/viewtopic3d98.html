		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First of all, I would just like to say thank you to the team, version 4 seems to be exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.<br /><br /><br />Here are some small bugs I am experiencing with 3.90:<br /><br />1. In Windows 8.1, there is a small bug with Metro apps. When you close an app and then open it with Classic Shell's metro menu, the app  starts exactly where it left off rather then starting anew, as it does when launched from the start page. This only happens on 8.1. It's worth noting that 8.1 handles closing metro apps differently than 8.0, leaving them still open in a dormant state.<br /><br />2. What may also be a potential bug is that I keep seeing the update icon beside the shutdown box on the start menu, this despite having all upates installed. Perhaps this is a bug with 8.1 itself and not the start menu?<br /><br />3. A very tiny cosmetic issue with the Windows 8 skin for the Windows 7 style start menu. When clicking the shutdown button, the button box left to fade away is missing its right side.<br /><br />Thanks for your time and a great program.

If you try to open them again from the Start screen, don't you see the same behavior? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> To truly close Metro apps in Windows 8.1 instantly, use Alt+F4. Or drag below and hold till they show their icon and then close.<br /><br />2. Have you restarted after installing all updates and yet you see the icon? Until you restart, it will show that icon. You can turn off the display of that icon by opening settings and going to General Behavior tab, unchecking the option &quot;Check for Windows updates on shutdown&quot;.<br /><br />Also, is it possible that one or two optional updates or Windows Defender definition updates are not yet installed even if you restarted? Basically, if there are any pending updates, the icon will show. If your Windows Update settings are set to &quot;Download updates but let me choose whether to install them&quot; or &quot;Install updates automatically&quot;, it shows.<br /><br />3. Didn't understand. A screenshot explaining what you mean would help.

If launched via the start screen, they start fresh but when launched via CS, they resume where they left off.<br /><br /> <div class="quotetitle">GauravK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">:) To truly close Metro apps in Windows 8.1 instantly, use Alt+F4. Or drag below and hold till they show their icon and then close.</div><br />Funny that you mention the drag and hold thing, I just found that out by accident and decided to come post it here. I was just dragging them off quickly before. The inconsistency with launching previously closed apps, (by quick drag down,) still happens but this takes care of it good enough for me.<br /><br /> <div class="quotetitle">GauravK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">2.

You can turn off the display of that icon by opening settings and going to General Behavior tab, unchecking the option &quot;Check for Windows updates on shutdown&quot;.</div><br />I've discovered whats going on here. I have all updates installed and have restarted multiple times since then. It gets triggered when I open Win Update even though there are ONLY 3 optional updates listed. This behavior is incorrect  for optional updates and furthermore, even if it wasn't, It should only show beside the shutdown button when there is a pending restart from updates that require it after they have been installed, not when there are optional or even important updates that have not been touched yet.<br /><br /> <div class="quotetitle">GauravK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Also, is it possible that one or two optional updates or Windows Defender definition updates are not yet installed even if you restarted?

These wouldn't exactly constitute pending updates since I have not selected to install them, which is what the shutdown update icon is for. <br /><br />My setting is &quot;Never check for updates&quot;, I like to do it manually and not be bothered to do it otherwise.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GauravK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">3.

I'll try to get something decent to post. It's really a tiny, minor thing though.

(not the prolonged drag down that rotates the tile showing the icon, that one will definitely close it all. Now try launching it again from the start screen, it will do the flippy animation and start the program back from the top but if you once again select another page, quick drag down to close and then open it via CS, it will quickly appear, (minus the flippy animation,) and be exactly where it left off. Just tried it with the app &quot;Notepad 8&quot;, same deal, type up a new doc, close via quick drag, re open via CS, it's where it left off, close the same way, open from start screen, fresh start.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Ivo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">2.

And if it's closed by holding it down for a longer time till the flip animation occurs, then it opens as before.
