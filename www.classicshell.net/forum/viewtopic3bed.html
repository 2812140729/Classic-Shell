		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just installed Windows 8, and the Classic Shell, but when I went to go move a lot of folders and files around to organize my stuff a little better, I keep getting the &quot;the action cannot be completed because the folder or a file in it is open in another program&quot; error message. Ive got nothing nothin else running these files/folders, and the only thing I can think of is that this is something to do with the Shell Explorer.<br /><br />Is there anything I can do about this? Is there a way I can perhaps shut off the Shell temporarily without having to uninstall it?<br /><br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You can try a tool like Process Explorer, that can search for open handles to specific files. A likely suspect for keeping files locked is AV software.<br /><br />There are ways to disable Classic Shell, but they are different for each component. The easiest is to just uninstall it. Your settings will be preserved for the next time you install.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Are you organizing/moving files from the network? Windows 7/8 still create the Thumbs.db file on network paths and it may be locking the folders. You can also use the free tool Unlocker to see what is locking the file but beware of forcibly unlocking it using Unlocker, that is not safe to do always.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />OT, but disturbing. Not being able to move files in W8 Windows Explorer is one thing, but not having any files to move is another. When I click &quot;Windows Key + E&quot; Windows Explorer comes up but there are either zero or 1 or 2 Folders/files in my Documents/Photos/Music Libraries. Did I miss an install step (it's been 24 hours now) or do I need to go into Recovery mode to a checkpoint prior to the Classic Shell install? I would really like this to work for me because it makes W8 what it should have been from the jump.
