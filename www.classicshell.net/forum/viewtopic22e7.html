I copied them to the folder stated in the help. I tried closing and restarting Classic Shell but still nothing new showed up in the list. Only the original skins. I'm using Windows 8.1 and Classic Shell 4.2.5. The skins I tried said they worked with the newer version of Classic Shell.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ugh, think i figured it out. if you go to start menu style and change it from windows 7 to two column different skins become available. i was set to windows 7 and all the skins I tried were not showing up. perhaps this post will help others running into this issue.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I later found another blog post about the same issue. So sorry for double posting. I think it would be a simple change to just mention in the help that the start menu style affects the skins available. Because I had no idea how this all worked and I read in the help that if you put the skins in the designated folder they would show up. It didn't mention that they wouldn't show up depending on start menu style. So just that simple fix would have been enough for me. I just happened to accidentally discover that. Then later read about it on the forum. But if you did change the program that could work also. Up to you guys.
