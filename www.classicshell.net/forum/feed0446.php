Windows 10 Creators Update has re-introduced this Vista-like behavior for List View of File Explorer. The improvement done in Windows 7 to make selection easier like XP has been destroyed. Now the entire row is selected in List View making it really hard to select files. If a file is already selected and you start dragging from an empty area to select more files, it interprets it as drag and drop. Also, de-selecting all files (select none) becomes more difficult.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Wed Jun 21, 2017 12:28 pm</p><hr />
