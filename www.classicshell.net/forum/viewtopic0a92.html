MS says its the OS our children will be using, but I'm wondering why they think our kids will be doing anything without our say-so.. seems a bit perverse..<br /><br />anyway, so is there no x64 version of Win10? what is the max supported RAM on w10? and how does it compare to Win7pro? <br /><br />I doubt I'll be migrating anytime soon. I'm also interested in how the firewall etc works, and if its a platform that limits freedom by controlling installs or existing programs or checks sources or works for the music industry or any kind of apple-esque BS<br /><br />Any reason one might actually want or need to change to WM10?<br /><br />thanks for any info

(free and easy)<br /><br />As far as what I think about windows 10...<br />Better than 8, worse than 8.1 (slightly, but I would still upgrade, because improvements are likely to come)<br />There are a few things I do really like:<br />The fact that apps can now be used in windowed mode, and virtually all fullscreen interfaces were removed (solvable on 8/8.1 with 3rd party software, and N/A on 7)<br />The new Task view, and multiple desktops. <br /><br /><br />My main gripe is the fact that some context menu's wont even pop up on my secondary monitor (IE if i try to bookmark a webpage in chrome, I have to move the window to my primary monitor to do so), Which to my knowledge isnt something affecting everyone with multiple monitors.

Glad I skipped that one.  <br /><br />It seems most of the win10 users have been tricked / forced into it,  which throws up a whole heap of red flags..  <br /><br />I was not impressed with the way they tried locking everyone into the upgrade.  I really hated that it was a hidden update..  Just a random update number that you had to go look up online to find out it was the windows 10 updater..  I really really can't stand that BS..  Its just dishonest.. Seems they're really just bulldozing it through..  Pretty Fn ballsy for a company that consistently releases more problems than it ever solves..  <br /><br />Its Shady all around..  fk em. I'm skipping it.

(basically windows now has an equivalent to the google play store) 95% of the old programs still worked in virtually the same way Windows 10 just bridged the gap, allowing apps to function properly in the desktop environment, and doing away with fullscreen interfaces. and yes it is shady that its given away free but my bet is they collect data or something

Besides games in the App Store, there is nothing of value in Windows 10 that is an improvement over Windows 7 and its app platform. Dozens of long standing features of Windows from XP days and Windows 7/Vista have been removed and overall the whole OS is tremendously dumbed down, offering less choices, less configurability and less features than earlier releases. Visually also, Windows 10 is hideously ugly. It offers no value at all. Everything about Windows 10 - performance of &quot;apps&quot; and any aesthetics, UI intuitiveness, usability, backward compatibility (especially old Win32 games) is crap.<br /><br />The big mistake is that WinRT is a mobile platform. It is not suitable for desktop use, it is not a superset or continuation of Win32. The Universal App Platform (WinRT-based APIs) are incomplete and the controls they use are unusable and ugly compared to Win32. Its concepts like responsive UI design are flawed and do not offer the best user experience. Features like Cortana are gimmicks and ruin the Start Menu search (if not for Classic Shell). Third party apps offer better alternatives for almost everything - VistaSwitcher is better than Task View, AquaSnap is better than the built-in snapping.<br /><br />The only improvements for me are DirectX 12, SMB 3 and Bluetooth audio profiles (the latter two were present in Windows 8 too) - none of them good enough to call Windows 10 an improvement over Windows 7 especially when the user experience has regressed so badly.

Win10 seems to be solidifying that even further<br /><br />The concept is completely flawed at its core, and its something I've tried advocating since Windows Mobile 2002, only to be slathered with mindless apple-groupie banter at every turn, and on every forum.<br /><br />The proper evolution should have been for Windows Mobile Devices to continue bridging the gap between the highly functional and customizeable Windows Mobile 2002 platform, and Windows XP, Utilizing the screen resolutions as they progressed from 640x480 screens up to HD, to improve the ability to use a fully-functioning Windows XP on a mobile device.<br /><br />BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br /><br />we had to all be betrayed by that clown of a company HTC that decided for the planet that we should all mimic iPhones instead. because, hey, if all the iPhone customers like it, and all the old people, kids, and tech-incompetent soccer moms out there were switching to iPhone, well then, that just means everybody should be forced fed a child-like interface with big colorful squares to push. <br /><br />We've been dumbed down since the day Android came out, in fact. From the day that disgusting braindead soccermon apple interface oozed its way over onto other platforms and all of our mobile devices now became things for your thumb to fliip around and exactly nothing else. <br /><br />Even blackberry's usefulness is completely gone..<br /><br />and I really thought Windows 7 would smarten up and have a version for Windows mobile phones that would work like a desktop on your phone.<br /><br />Mobile CPUs, GPUs, Screen Resolution, RAM, etc are all way better than Desktops were when winXP came out<br /><br />And I'm sickened to see that all that computing power and screen real estate has been reduced to some fking BS you flip to and fro with your thumb whilst playing pocket pool in your slacks on the way to the elevator<br /><br />Windows 7 should be available on an HD or Quad HD Mobile Device. <br /><br />The only thing Microsack should have been working on is a way to make zoom, panning, screen resizing, and window snapping more intuitive and automatic for mobile hand-held devices.<br /><br />As well as creating docking systems for Monitors and Keyboard / mouse so that you can do all of your computing on your hand held device, and not even need a desktop for most things, nor even a tablet. <br /><br />And that phone should send display to tablets and tvs around the home<br /><br />and come built in with 4 removable micro sd slots on the external surface of the phone, that can also be used for RAM emulation, as well as for internal HDD Storage<br /><br />and thats all they should have been doing<br /><br />rather than embarrassing everyone with their Windows Phone OS.<br /><br />It's not too late for them to create a Windows MOBILE 7 and leave Windows Phone 7 for the grandparents, toddlers, soccermoms, and corporate baffoons. <br /><br />but they're running with their Windows Phone crap, to 8, and soon 10... turning our desktops into useless soccer-mom garbage mega-giant-phones, rather than making our phones useful powerful machines for techies. <br /><br />its just ridiculous.<br /><br />all its serving to really do is drive everyone away from computers altogether. <br /><br />The farther these things progress, the more time I spend outdoors uninterested in computers at all.<br /><br />so.. thanks but no thanks.

They called in the best programmers they had available, who they normally have painting the walls and mowing the lawns apparently, and somehow created in Windows 7 what took them over a decade to complete with Windows XP, which actually wasnt really complete at all, even after SP3<br /><br />Windows 7 is their best OS to date. <br /><br />We've all suffered miserably through the countless fails and mishaps MS has created over the past 20+ years<br /><br />If they think not bringing DX12 to W7 is going to force people into W10, they can go Fk themselves. <br /><br />I would rather never buy another new game from any game company, ever. <br /><br />so, screw off game companies, I'm not paying you jack sht for your game because Im not being forced into any OS by Microsack so that they can feel they're fkd up ideas for an OS were a success. They're not. <br /><br />so, oh well.. guess I'll be using my PC for things other than games. Hence, the reason I have a PC and not a PS or Xbox, FYI

(Would I prefer it with the features and stability of 7; ofcourse, but ill take it over an android phone) The point is, its their OS, and they can take it wherever they wish (wherever the money leads) It makes me sad sure..  but i'm not going to take it personal

Windows XP, was GENEROUSLY given an extra 5 years of support to (that they were not obligated to in any way) I suspect they will do the same with 7.<br />I've still got a windows 7 PC, and one with windows 8.1, and other than a little popup ASKING me if I wanted to upgrade to windows 10 for free.. It has made no attempts to upgrade without my consent...<br />Now there have been some things, I've been displeased with (the removal of widgets in windows 7 for example, when they were a key feature PROMISED to its users) No I didn't use them.. (well I did actually use 2-3 of them for a while), It was about principal.<br />And again, its unlikely that any games will require DX12 for a while (even if they support it, they will probably run in a lower version just fine) This will probably remain, as-long as windows 7 holds a sizable market share.<br /><br />Besides its never to late for microsoft to decide on porting it to 7/8, Though I suspect some fundamental reasons might make this difficult (or cause major performance issues)

WE tell Microcrap what we'll do, irregardless of the little sadsacks' megalomaniacal demands. <br /><br />Windows 7 will stand as long as we say it will stand.

(They very well may have planted a back-door or 2 in its core coding) I actually like 7 better than 8/10... <br />Is there no easy way to disable the little Icon that ask if you WANT to upgrade? Yes its slightly inconvenient for a minute or so, but considering how 'stupid' people can be, a fool-proof way to help the masses upgrade was IMO warranted. and that's what windows 10 is targeted at..<br />Also there will always (for quite a while atleast) be clean copies of windows 7, because there will always be torrents <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />Every update in windows 7 can be uninstalled, even after it has been installed..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Fortunately, the game manufacturers have no loyalty to Windows 10 or DX12, and will likely still be making games that most of its PC gaming crowd can use with their Win7 machines.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this also makes it more likely that more game manufacturers won't even bother porting their games to PC anymore, which was already hard enough to get them to do.<br /><br />QuadHD, which I guess is a main thing in DX12, doesnt improve much for computer monitors as doubling the HD pixels on a relatively small screen size doesnt help to improve perceptible quality much at all, as there exists more data than the human eye can even perceive. QuadHD will do nothing at all for mobile phones or computers unless they build a way to use auto zoom, panning and snapping in for access to the real estate, rather than simply doubling the existing pixels in everything we see, leaving everything unchanged, like they did when HD came out.<br /><br />I just don't feel they know what to do with screen technology as it comes out. everything stays exactly the same size, the only thing it does for us is make everything more glossy and annoying, as if the sum of all that work making higher resolutions was simply to make things look more plastic-like<br /><br />Current Scrolling really sucks.. we should actually be able to zoom in and out on our desktops like you do in any graphics program, then zoom to cursor, or click on dynamic highlighted areas that shift, or drag the mouse to an area to fill the screen.. We should be able to have 4 or 8 full page programs open and viewable at the same time, with an adjustable resolution that lowers in quality scaleable with the needed screen real estate size you select.<br /><br />text is text whether its on 640x480 or 4K resolution. And creating 3D Graphics is creating 3d Graphics, on 640x480 or 4K.<br /><br />The only thing they've used the Resolution for is watching tv, playing games, and fingerfking apps to death.. as if it has nothing at all to do with computing..<br /><br />and nobody cares that microsack has created a new DX12 that can use 4K to make everything function exactly as it functions now, but with even more shiny glossiness
