For me one of the best ways to know if it&#39;s real or not is via my phishing blockers, and such. I also have add blockers active on all of my browsers for that same reason. Not to mention I use windows live for my more important e-mails due to it&#39;s built in security features being far better than what other e-mail providers have. All in all though, point being said, i do agree that people can be really stupid when it comes to hiding the nature of the virus or such in the title of the download, lolz.<br /><br />Also, on that matter, the term bovirus, if you think about it, can also be a somewhat cryptic way of hiding the nature of a virus filled program by naming it after a type of virus &#40;in other words, it could be used as the term &#39;bovine virus&#39; but simply merged together into a slightly and very badly cryptic name&#41;. </span></span></span> <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#dce1e5;"> No offense intended there, the thought popped into my head while i was typing so i figured i&#39;d kinda play around with that idea, lolz. I found it to be a kinda funny interpretation rofl.</span></span></span> <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Intentionally named to scare novice users away, because they have no purpose downloading such files anyways..<br /><br />Then you get people trying to trick others into running the files just for kicks... Sure they could save the file, change the filename, and re-host it on some free uploader site. but thats not fun for them....<br /><br /><br />Any 'Virus' worth its salt, isnt going to announce its a virus.<br />with exception to scare-ware, there is no strategic advantage to doing so...
