		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />It is, what it is.<br />That's as far as I can take it.<br /><br /><strong>Win 10 Concept [Classic 2 only] Use with CSM version 4.3.0</strong><br /><br />Skin can work at regular 100% (96 dpi) size, or 150% (144 dpi) HiDPI size.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> HAVE TO LOAD XML FILE FOR IT TO WORK PROPERLY <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <br />The xml file turns second column to buttons feature.<br />It will look pretty ugly, until the xml file is loaded.<br />Unzip file, put skin in the skin folder of Classic Shell ( C:\Program Files\Classic Shell\Skins )<br />Right click on Start button to get settings window. Click on back up button at bottom. Click load from XML file.<br />Open &quot;Win 10 Concept.xml&quot; at your unzip location. If menu does not change, you might have to exit CSM, and restart it. <br /><br /><br />This skin is a concept for a simpler alternate Windows 10 start menu. Not for Win 7 Operating system, as it has Metro colors. <br />Can work on Win 8, results will vary. <br /><br />It does work somewhat, as the fake tiles are linked shortcuts, just locked up positions. <br />The tile text is from screenshots.<br />Can't move tiles around, can't resize them, can't remove/add, and can't be live animated. <br />So many restrictions. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Edit: Another restriction. Second column can only be English language. Sorry.<br />The text emblem would have to be redone for another language. Not impossible, just would take some time.<br /><br />The xml file is set to small icons at 16 size on 100% system size. <br />You can set to 24 size if you wish, to match better. Use CSM settings &quot;Menu Look&quot; tab. <br />On HiDPI small icons defaults to 24 size. Changing to 32 size might look better, as well.<br />Please don't change the large icon size in CSM settings, <br />for the right tile alignment will seriously go out of whack. <br />The alignments all will go every which way.<br /><br /><br />The second column has two types of tiles.<br />One of them, kind of resembles the Win10 tiles. <br />Both these types have smaller squares than real Win 10. Yes, they both look like calculator menus. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />I reduced tile size to 80% of original size, because when tiles all same color, <br />they are too over powering, especially lime green color. <br />Second type is smaller tile, at 40% of original.<br />Last type has no tiles at all, with selector resembling on the desktop. <br /><br /><br />As above, tiles are burnt into the skin, which means the tiles and text are frozen in place. <br />The good thing is the links do work, when set up correctly. <br />If any of the links don't work on a different computer,<br />try making a shortcut and store somewhere. Link to that shortcut.<br />If it does not work, I'm sure Gaurav knows all the direct links, and can supply them. <br /><br /><br /><span style="background-color:#ffcc00;">Edit</span>: Minor addition. Added extra color shade option. Now revision B<br />I realized afterwards why the normal color shade option is washed out, when transparency is on.<br />Original MS Win 10 changes the menu background from SystemAccentDark1 when opaque, to SystemAccentDark2 if transparency.<br />Was going to make it switch automatically, then decided to put as another color shade option.<br />Your choice, you pick. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Background notes.<br /><br />At first, I was experimenting with the icon frame skin feature, pushing it out more. Was thinking this is great. <br />Then, when I made the text as an emblem, the text disappeared, because the text is behind the icon frame. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />Emblems are like layers in photo editors. The top most layer is the most visible. I tried emblem 10 instead of emblem 1, no change.<br />I surmise bottom layer is menu skin, then emblems 1 thru 10, then icon frames, then icon, then selector, then text at top.<br />Back to the drawing board, to try different approach.<br /><br />The only way to look like Metro, was I made a screen shot of what was made so far, <br />and used that as the bitmap, with the tiles on the bitmap.<br />Big honking bitmaps, that had to be exact, which was a pain.<br />Surprising though, due to fact that there is no texture in bitmaps,<br />when they got converted to png format, menu file size is small. <br /><br />Because the tile text screenshot had to resemble font smoothing, <br />I had to do a trick to it, so it looks same on dark and light tiles. <br />First I set a different glass skin to grey color, in front of grey background. Took a screenshot.<br />Erased the surrounding menu, that left just the white text, with it's darker Clear Type pixels.<br />I adjusted the gamma of text lower, and used as the alpha layer. I made the gamma higher, and put in the rgb layer.<br />This roughly imitates the look, without having too white or too dark edges around text.

Instead of just a square bitmap used for the icon frame, <br />he put another bitmap to the right, and combined it into one.<br />Along with some sort of coding in his program (I don't see or would understand coding if I saw it), the icon frame will show with, or without the selector button.<br />Freaken Amazing. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I only just found out about this, and is not in the skin I made. <br />Did not try it out fully, but this could also mean the color of the icon frame could be changed too, as it has two states!

Putting the bitmap to the right, I'm not sure how that works, it sounds interesting though.<br /><br />I tried to make mail on your start menu have a text label to show. It didn't work.

I had another version where the selector color inside the tile changed a different color.<br />Really was chaotic.

New to me too.<br />I think Ivo has something like this for the search arrow too, where instead of an arrow with states above each other,<br />It's to the right.<br />Never figured it out yet though.<br /><br />Here is another option that got removed.<br />It was an emblem which only showed, if lots of entries in left column. <br />It filled the empty space below the tiles.<br />If I had a lot of time, I could have shrunk the pictures more to fit properly. <br />They are not user replaceable, so I chopped them out.<br /><br />You may not hear from me for the next few weeks.

I cannot suggest anyone of anyother way to get the feel of windows 10, if he is using any other OS.<br />Your brilliant expertise and stability and speed of Classic Shell, made this skin a lovely experience.<br /><br />Then, I got idea to do some tinkering with the skin as I have not anything to do these days.<br />So, Started Reshacking.<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> Too many Images And Bitmaps and a long script.<br />But I lifted my confidence and digged in.<br /><br />Firstly I sorted out the script in my way.<br />Uff Too many cut, paste and scroll.<br />Took about Half an Hour. Still OPTIONS And VARIATIONS remaining.<br />Left the idea. Shut off my PC.<br /><br />Still Thinking How Juniper built the skin.<br />I gather that much that you used Emblems and tiles burnt in the Main_bitmap by reading the posts.<br />I didn't understand how you managed the second columns items to be present in rows.<br />Kept Thinking but can't understand.<br /><br />Filled With Curiosity, I started my PC and loaded the default metro skin but with your XML settings.<br />And <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> What I see. Second Columns Items automatically arranged in that form.<br />Searched thru menu settings and learnt how this is done in Customize Menu Items Section.<br /><br />So, I left the half-edited skin of yours,<br />Done changed to Omni-Pic Skin to get the look.<br />Slowly Slowly I get a windows 10 style.<br />It is not complete yet, even not started properly.<br />Tile names are remaining and I think it is essential part behind the use of emblems.<br /><br />Here's a screenshot. Currently skin don't use the any emblems.<br />I actually liked the screenshot posted by splitwirez of transparent menu.<br />I was browsing the post on my phone which have OLED Display. There It look like a diamond. Not that good on my ugly LCD display.<br />I tried to get that look by doing changes alpha channel and even taken the screenshot with same desktop background behind.<br /><br />Waiting for any advice.

You found it anyway.<br /><br />Splitwirez one is nice. I had tried with the tile buttons as transparent, but figured MS has them as solid opaque, I'll do same.<br /><br />Yours look very nice too.

I don't even remember the technique.<br />Damn, I should have at least kept the note how I did it. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br />I think it was have an incorrect bitmap slice to show a total invisible menu, then have it show the white menu text in front of a black desktop background, then screenshot it.<br />I remember making it with Clear type colored pixels, but clear type never looks good with a transparent menu, <br />which is probably why MS does not use it either on their menu.<br /><br />I had everything ready to change if someone wanted in French, or whatever. Waited for a long time, then deleted everything.<br />It still sucks, because screenshots don't change with other language. <br /><br /><br />I think it is true about search background not available in classic style.<br />In most skins, it does not really matter except the magnifier search bitmap has to have the white halo around it, and the x, arrows. <br />Or have a white and black set for black and light menus.<br />If you figured a way to extend the box, that is great trick. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It's always the problem with transparent menus. You can get it to look beautiful with a particular background, <br />only for it to turn into a washed out hard to read, put on the sun glasses menu.<br />Could always have option to switch to darker version for bright backgrounds,<br />or copy the transparency amount that MS made with the tiles transparent for Action center.

It had modified dither noise with vertical gradient.<br /><br />I wonder if MS has a sample noise image in one of their files somewhere, or is it just code that makes the noise?<br />If I open the &quot;Photos&quot; app, and make a screenshot of its active title bar in front of white/black background, this picture is what it looks like.<br />I duplicated bar below to see better. <br /><br />[How do you feel about it?]<br />You are going to hate me now. If I look at it too much, I want to wipe my monitor to get rid of the dust, but it's not dust, <br />it's the noise. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />I hope I did not waste your time on a wild goose chase. If anything It looks better without the noise, or just have it on either the tiles part, or background part, but not both.<br /><br /><br />[ search box extension]<br />Same thing, same difference. Here, I try different words. You made the search bitmap elements show inside the white search box, rather than outside.<br />How did you do that magic? or keeping trick safe. A good magician never reveals his tricks. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />[Emblems get hidden behind Icon frame.]<br />From what I remember, yes. I think I tried highest priority emblem numbers too, but that is just for emblem layers, not icon frame/selectors.<br />What is your trick? more transparent?<br /><br />Yeah. If Ivo could find some way to have real text show for buttons/fake tiles, like Start 9 menu, then everything would be a lot simpler. <br />Would not need so many screenshots.<br />Time to go, bye.

Words open like; &quot; You Have Already Found The Program But Feature Is Not Hidden.&quot;<br />So, follow the steps below to get the text labels to your liking:-<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note1:-</span> I tried with MS Office 2013. Don't know older versions have the features required to do the trick or not. If someone using older version, tell me about your experience.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note2:-</span> Nevertheless, If someone is using older version, go to bing.com and use online office. I had not used it but pretty much sure, they will have required features.<br /><br />1] Open the Tile Text.xlsx file in excel.<br /><br />2] There you will see Documents written everywhere. Delete the Document and Put the text what you want.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Caution:-</span> Don't try to mess with width and height of columns and rows, otherwise alignment go out of bounce.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Check:-</span> Check if the grid-lines are shown or not. If shown, then go to &quot;VIEW&quot; button in the Ribbon and uncheck the Gridline option.<br /><br /><br />3] Once all the text labels are done,select the cells upto row &quot;E&quot; And Column &quot;15&quot;.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note3:-</span> Currently arrangements are made for 3 X 5 Tile Menu only.<br /><br />4] Ok, now in the HOME Button, select arrow in the copy button, and then &quot;Copy As Picture&quot;. Select the As Shown In Screen And As Picture.<br /><br />5] Once copied, Open the Powerpoint and Paste there.<br /><br />6] Right Click and then &quot;Save As Picture&quot;. Give the name what you want and select file type as PNG.<br /><br />Ok, now load the skin file. Open Menu Settings--&gt;Skin and point to the above created file in the &quot;Tile Text&quot; Option and and Point to &quot;Tile Background.bmp&quot; [present in the zip] in the &quot;Tile background&quot; Option.<br /><br />Change Large Icon Size to 24.<br /><br />Choose other settings to your liking.<br /><br />Menu Settings.xml is also present in the zip, Well, most of options are set defaults in the XML. Load it if something is not getting right.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note4:-</span> If alignment is still not getting right, check the file dimensions of newly created Tile Text.png file match with the already present the Tile Text.png file.<br />If these are not matching, then you have to wait. Actually there is little problem with Powerpoint Right Click &quot;Save as Picture&quot; Option. It's export DPI seems to change due to some conditions which I don't know. I will try to find the solution.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note5:-</span> Skin is surely not adapted to high DPI. But coming soon.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Note On Icon And Tile Sizes:-</span> Microsoft Tile Size is 100 px. I am using 90 px. Separation between the tile is same 4 px.<br />Microsoft is using 24 px icon size in the All Apps list. Same here but second column have larger icons in MS Menu.<br /><br />Do You Know how to change the icon size of second column separately?<br /><br />So that's all. Use the skin and tell what are glitches or features you want.

I don't have microsoft office, or powerpoint. Open office is free, while microsoft office is paid only. I'll try your .skin out soon. I currently can't download the .skin, the forums won't allow me.
