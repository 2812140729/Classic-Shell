The only known bug that may have been introduced in 4.3.0 is that if you use the blank &lt;No Skin&gt; skin, some icons may not show up in the start menu.<br />There are many new features in 4.3.0, especially around skinning the start menu and the taskbar. Other than that, there should be no performance difference.<br />I am not aware of any settings or customizations that will behave differently.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Wed Aug 17, 2016 7:37 pm</p><hr />

I generally like to keep up to date, but I also am a bit conservative.<br /><br />I presume the latest release been tested well on Win 8.1 - I know Gaurav runs Win 8.1 on his good computer.<br /><br />Right now Classic Shell 4.2.5 is running perfectly for me.  I mean really perfectly - my system runs essentially for as long as some install or update doesn't require a reboot.  Right now, that's a week of fairly intensive work.<br /><br />My system's functionality and stability is pretty important to me, so, when considering whether to upgrade Classic Shell to 4.3.0 I have to consider the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>Is it stable?</li><li>Will performance be as good (or ideally enhanced)?</li><li>Will a modestly customized configuration be maintained well across the upgrade?</li><li>Are there recently discovered bugs that will lead to another update soon?</li></ul><br />I've already tested it successfully myself in Win 7, 8.1, and 10 virtual machines.<br /><br />Based on my own testing - and without discovering here a reason to hold off - I'll put it on my workstation fairly soon.<br /><br />Anyway, Thanks to Ivo, Gaurav, and others involved with the project for all your good work!  Classic Shell has been great to have for the many years I've used it.<br /><br />-Noel<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=552">NoelC</a> — Wed Aug 17, 2016 1:07 pm</p><hr />
