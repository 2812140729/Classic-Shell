I am hooking the taskbar an hiding the start button when the taskbar gets hidden.<br />Please try a few things:<br />1) Unlock the taskbar and move it to the side. See if the start button goes with it. This will show if the taskbar is correctly hooked<br />2) Go to the Nvidia control panel and disable the other monitors. See if the problem remains. This will show if the problem is related to having multiple monitors

I only updated to 4.0.0.<br /><br />Here are some Programs i'm running everytime i use my computer.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I am having the exact same problem. Every computer in my house uses Nvidia software, but we do not have any multi monitor setups among them. Every computer in the house is single monitor only. We are running Windows 8.0 Pro 64 bit on all machines concerned. A few days ago, I made the mistake of updating Classic Shell on my husband's computer from 3.6* to 4.0. That was the only change made to the machine in question. When Classic Shell restarted after the update, it made me go through the setup from the beginning, as it had somehow lost some of my husband's settings from the previous installation. Except for the fact that I could not quite get his start menu to look quite like it did before, I thought nothing of it until I noticed that while he was playing Star Trek Online in full screen mode, the Classic Shell button was hovering on top of his game window. The previous version of Classic Shell did not have this problem, and the update in question was the only change made (other than possible automatic updates to the operating system itself).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Additional information:  it seems like the bug in question may be happening when my husband clicks on the windows key to pull up the classic shell start menu while running his full screen application, and then clicks on the task bar icon for the game (Star Trek Online in this case) to bring it back to full screen.  While I was watching him play, it looked as though when he clicked the windows key a second time to close the classic shell start menu rather than clicking an icon on the task bar that the problem did not occur.

Or switching between windowed(fullscreen) and fullscreen.  (I know this doesnt solve the issue, just hides it, but it might allow you to play that specific game...
