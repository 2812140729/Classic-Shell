		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When I had installed Classic Shell v.4.3.0 on the initial installation of Win 10x64 (in a dual boot with Win 7x64), it worked fine. <br /><br />However, that Win 10 installation developed other problems, and I had to delete its partition and start over. I re-installed Windows 10, and it seemed to go okay (except that the Windows boot menu <span style="text-decoration: underline">also</span> lists the older, removed Win 10 boot choice-that doesn't work. Booting from the newer Win 10 choice does start Win 10.) My plan is to deal with removing the old Win 10 listing later.<br /><br />I soon installed Classic Shell on this new, working installation of Windows 10, but every time I click on the Start button, it doesn't show the Classic Shell. The Programs' listing in the Win 10 Start does show that Classic Shell has been installed, but it doesn't actually show the Classic Shell formatting; it is still the Win 10 look. <br /><br />I have gone into the Settings for Classic Shell, double-checked that its settings were to my liking, but nothing changes when I click on the Start button immediately or after a re-boot. I even looked for ancillary files and folders associated with Classic Shell, and found one in Program Data folder. I removed it after uninstalling Classic Shell, rebooted and tried again.<br /> <br />It appears, therefore, that Classic Shell is getting installed, as evidenced by the ability to edit its options, but selecting the Start button does NOT show the Classic Shell; it shows the standard Windows 10 Start.<br /><br />I'd appreciate any ideas any one may have.

I used it once when I removed everything that had been previously set, rebooted, and re-installed to no avail. Then, I did it again, where I left the settings; it still didn't work. <br /><br />And all of this is, as far as I know, before knowingly installing the Windows Creator update. <br /><br />However, I did read that the next release of Classic Shell is configured to work with Windows 10, and I suppose I should wait for it.<br /><br />If anyone has any other interim suggestions or a probable release date for the update to Classic Shell, please let me know.

Click Save to XML files. Upload that XML file here attached inside a ZIP so we can take a look at your settings and find what's wrong.

Open File Explorer and go to C:\Program Files\Classic Shell. Right click ClassicStartMenu.exe and click Copy. Now close File Explorer.<br /><br />2. Press Win+R keys to open Run dialog. Type the following and press Enter:<br />shell:startup<br /><br />3. A folder will open at this path:<br />C:\Users\&lt;YOUR USER NAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup<br /><br />4. In this folder, right click the white area and choose &quot;Paste shortcut&quot;.<br /><br />5. Right click the shortcut to the Start menu that just got created and choose &quot;Properties&quot;. Go to the Compatibility tab. Make sure that the following checkbox is UNCHECKED:<br />&quot;Run this program as an administrator&quot;.<br /><br />Click OK. Now the Start menu should work for you after a reboot when you click the Start button.

I especially made sure that that the &quot;Run this program as an 'Administrator,' was unchecked.<br /><br />Two other pieces of information may help.<br /><br />Before I received your reply: <br /><br />1. I added access to the Administrator User account. Curiously, Classic Shell works fine in that user account. (Perhaps because it is the Administrator user?)<br /><br />2. However, when logged in as a &quot;normal&quot; user, I noticed that the Classic Shell <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">only opens</span></strong> when I press the Windows key, but it never starts with Windows itself. Each time I want to use Classic Shell, I have to press the Windows key. It helps, but it is not really a solution.<br /><br />Does any of this information promote any further ideas?<br /><br />Many thanks for continuing to try to solve this problem.

When I am logged in as a regular user, that is the only thing that actually causes the Classic Shell to show, but I have to press that keyboard key every time I want to access Classic Shell. When I am logged in as Administrator, the Classic Shell opens from the Start button on the screen - every time.

Additionally, I ran several Registry checkers, including CCleaner. It found more stuff, and I got rid of that too.<br /><br />Then I rebooted, again, and re-installed Classic Shell in the non-Adminstrator (so named) user; note, however, that this other user is also marked as being an administrator, just not &quot;THE&quot; Administrator.<br /><br />As usual, the installation went fine, and indeed, the Classic Shell configuration came up when I clicked on the Start button. Once set, the Start button opens Classic Shell each time! <br /><br />Next, I rebooted, and logged in as &quot;The&quot; Administrator user, and again, Classic Shell opened without difficulty!<br /><br />I don't know what happened originally, but it is all working now.<br /><br />Thanks for your guidance - and that special Utility!
