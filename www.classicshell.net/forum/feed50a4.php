<strong><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;">This is not a general purpose Windows support forum for your computer problems. If your issue isn't related to Classic Shell's Start Menu or Explorer addons, you should post it on some big Windows support community such as Neowin, EightForums/SevenForums or MyDigitalLife forum.</span></strong> If you post something unrelated to Classic Shell, post in the Chit Chat forum but note that you may or may not get an answer.<br /><br />Please read the FAQ here: <strong><a href="http://www.classicshell.net/faq/" class="postlink">http://www.classicshell.net/faq/</a></strong> to troubleshoot your issues. It may save you the trouble of asking questions in the forum which are already answered in the FAQ.<br /><br />Classic Shell also ships with a help file which may answer your query. You can access it by right clicking the Start button -&gt; Help or by pressing F1 in the Settings window. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">There are over 5300 topics in the forum so your question may already be covered. It is advised that you search for your issue first in the forum to see if it has already been answered before creating a post. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">If the forum search feature restricts certain words or isn't helpful, then kindly search the forum using Google or Bing as follows:<br /><br /></span></strong><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"> &lt;enter search terms&gt; site:classicshell.net/forum<br /><br />e.g.1, if you don't know how to change Start button, <br /><br />In Google or Bing's search box, type: change start button site:classicshell.net/forum <br /><br />e.g. 2 if you want to know how to add some folder, let's say, 'Videos' to the Start menu, search like this:</span></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">In Google or Bing's search box, type: add videos start menu site:classicshell.net/forum </span></strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>If your question is about the Start Menu, please state what style of the menu you are using and what Windows operating system your PC is running.<br /></strong></span></span><br /><br />Searching the forum will save your time and our time too if you find a thread already with your query resolved. So please search before asking the same things which are already in the forum. <br /><br /><br />If you have trouble finding a setting, there is a search box in the Settings dialog where you can try typing its description. If you don't understand what a particular Classic Shell setting does, simply hover your mouse over it, and tooltip help will appear explaining what the setting controls. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 175%; line-height: 116%;"><strong>Important posts in each subforum are also pinned at the top of each subforum for your convenience. There are Start Menu related guides and tutorials in the Start menu section of the forum.

You can post in older threads if it is related to your issue. But for unrelated issues, try to avoid hijacking other users' threads by posting completely different questions in other users' topics.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>If your issue is resolved, kindly mark the topic as solved by clicking the green check mark at the bottom of the post.</em></span></strong><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> â€” Sun Oct 27, 2013 9:20 am</p><hr />
