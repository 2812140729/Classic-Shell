Classic Shell is a suite of 3 free components - Start Menu, File Explorer enhancements and Internet Explorer additions. Where did you install it from? If you installed it from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell">http://www.classicshell</a><!-- m --><strong>.net</strong>, you can be assured that it doesn't cause any popups, nags or anything in Internet Explorer nor does it install any unwanted crapware. It is free software so it certainly doesn't have a goal to annoy the user with popups or anything.  <br />  <br />If you installed it from some other website like CNET's Download.com, or classicshell<strong>.com</strong>, then those websites may be bundling ads, popups and other crap along with it. Do not install from any other website except the official website. <br />  <br />Your IE browser may also have been hijacked by something else but you can be 100% sure that Classic Shell does not install anything that causes popups or annoyances in IE.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Mon Nov 18, 2013 6:02 am</p><hr />

I have been using versions of Classic Shell on Windows 8 computers since May 2013. <br />I have been so frustrated and tried everything I could to over the last several months to get rid of the annoying whole,new page,pop ups- Opinion Polls (with Audio--&quot;Thank you for visiting....&quot;), Bogus Flash Player and IE update warnings that would all but lock down IE without my ending processes through Task Manager. <br />This occurred every time I would click on user login field, but before I entered my user name.  This occurred in Gmail, Hotmail, banking, box.com, DocuSign and most anything that had a login.<br /> <br />Finally, I uninstalled Classic Shell and the problem has gone away. It has removed the annoying pop ups in IE. <br /> <br />I HATE Windows 8 and loved Classic Shell as an option.  However, something had to give to get rid of the pop ups.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2280">reggietill</a> — Mon Nov 18, 2013 5:42 am</p><hr />
