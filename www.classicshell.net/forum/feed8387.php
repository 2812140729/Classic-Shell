It can be due to a shell extension DLL that is installed. You could temporarily uninstall Classic Shell and see if the problem goes away. Classic Shell preserves its settings in the Registry even if it is uninstalled. If not, then your issue isn't related to Classic Shell. You could try doing a System Restore to an older date when your system was working OK.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Wed Sep 07, 2016 11:13 pm</p><hr />

Hi, I would like to ask about a problem using Classic Shell in Windows 10 x64, hope I am in the right forum area. Classic Shell installation was not blocked by 10, installed and updated looked like successfully, and worked for a while. But now right click will not work at all in these areas: <br />Start Menu <br />Taskbar <br />Windows system files <br />quick launch <br />desktop <br />most shortcuts anywhere <br /><br />In some cases, left clicking the item will not work either.<br /><br />This is a description of what happens when an item is right clicked: A blank white screen pops very fast, like a flash, then desktop comes back gradually, but it's the default Windows 10 start button and taskbar, the Classic Shell start button and other settings are gone. This lasts for 30-60 seconds, then the Classic Shell appearance comes back. I have researched the right click not working and found this problem is connected to a proliferation of .dll application extension files from add-ons and other programs. I disabled every .dll from programs I don't use. I am left with the Classic Shell, original context menu, and necessary system .dlls. This solved right click disappearance within some folders, but no where else. This and the fact that Classic Shell disappears momentarily each time I try right clicking seem to indicate the problem is coming from Classic Shell and Windows 10 somehow. Has anyone else seen this problem or does anyone know how to fix it? I can't run scannow or checkdisk because I cannot bring up any context menus with right click, and so am unable to run command prompt (or anthing else) as administrator. Thanks very much in advance for any advice anyone can give me!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15041">UnknownBmovieActress</a> — Wed Sep 07, 2016 2:20 pm</p><hr />
