For Windows 10 Anniversary Update or future Windows 10 releases, see this blog post: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/fix-classic-shell-on-windows-10-anniversary-update/">http://winaero.com/blog/fix-classic-she ... ry-update/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Classic Shell's menu is actually superior in my opinion than the Windows 10 menu for many, many reasons. Here are <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/15-reasons-to-use-classic-shells-start-menu-in-windows-10/" class="postlink"><strong><em>15 reasons to use Classic Shellâ€™s Start Menu in Windows 10</em></strong></a>.<br /><br />Windows 10's Search/Cortana Search is broken and often does not return the correct search results even if the file or shortcut exists on your drive. It <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2017/01/07/microsoft-broke-search-in-windows-10-somehow-fix-inside/" class="postlink"><strong>also sometimes completely breaks</strong></a> because it is poorly designed to do a round-trip to the web to return local search results. And it always does an incomplete job of searching your local PC, that is, it never reliably finds everything, search results are highly inconsistent.<br /><br />The main feature of Windows 10's Start Menu is Live Tiles. Live Tiles cannot be used in Desktop (Win32) apps because Microsoft didn't allow that. To use Live Tiles APIs, your app must be a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, so Live Tiles are out of the question for Classic Shell. Plus, Classic Shell's philosophy is backward compatible design. Live Tiles don't fit into this design. Live Tiles are not designed with usability in mind for mouse users - medium and larger sizes take too much space and the small size does not show titles. There are many other limitations to Live Tiles too - you can't easily change their icon, can't launch them by keyboard accelerators, can't pin multiple tiles or select them at once in Windows 10. You can't even rename them!<br /><br /><br />If you are always using the latest Windows 10 Insider Builds, Classic Shell usually always has issues on these newest builds because Microsoft keeps changing Windows 10. These issues will be fixed after a stable, final (RTM) version of Windows 10 is released for that wave (Threshold 1, Threshold 2, RedStone 1 etc). Despite minor issues, Classic Shell should detect when you do a Windows 10 build upgrade and its self-healing functionality will kick in and repair any functionality that broke due to the upgrade.<br /><br />If you want Windows 10 Start Menu features and ideas in Classic Shell's menu, see the discussion below. You are welcome to give your feedback and make feature requests.<br /><br />Older discussion of Classic Shell on Windows 10 follows below (from August 2014).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />What is it about the Windows 10 Start Menu that is desirable? Anything specific? Gadgets are better than Live Tiles and came first.<br /><br />Gadgets could be placed anywhere, you could interact with them, expand them, resize them and the Gadget platform was open meaning you weren't restricted to a Store to obtain them. Also, Gadgets were graphically and functionally richer. In comparison, Live Tiles have the Metro style mono color design, can only be resized, and you can't do any interaction with them currently, so they are not as capable as Gadgets were. The &quot;apps&quot; that those Tiles open are ridiculously bad and keep changing.<br /><br />Personally, I think Live Tiles are still no match for Gadgets so I always put back Gadgets on newer versions of Windows like Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. <br /><br /><br />You can put back gadgets from sites like <a href="http://www.gadgetsrevived.com/" class="postlink"><strong><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;">www.gadgetsrevived.com</span></strong></a>. Plus, Microsoft hasn't opened up the possibility of third parties using Live Tiles in desktop apps. You need to convert the whole Win32 app into a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app to use Live Tiles.<br /><br />The only improvement I see in the Windows 10 menu is being able to pin items in the right side area and organize them into groups.<br /><br />Personally I find that the second column is better utilized for showing expandable/cascading folders. Icons in the tray (notification area) for the apps you use already pretty much do what Live Tiles do except that they are not as space-hogging as Live Tiles. I see Live Tiles as just as gimmick on the mouse/keyboard-oriented Desktop. They were a good idea on smaller screen, touch devices where the Tiles are the only way to launch the app, they need to be larger for your finger. Or if Windows didn't have a separate notification area/notification center, then Live Tiles would've been useful to some extent.<br /><br />I already cannot tolerate the fact that they got rid of Desktop Gadgets to push those Tiles.<br /><br />Classic Shell does not force choices, it has unrivaled customization so such a big change even if it was possible and implemented will be optional.

That would be acceptable but these tiles inside the Start Menu sorry but no. <br />They take too much space and look terrible on big screens.

It's better than nothing but only about 20% as good as what you've already got in Classic Shell.<br /><br />Edit:  I've just installed Classic Shell.  <strong>Your program actually fixes a new problem with a Taskbar that's been auto-hidden</strong> (basically without Classic Shell it won't open if you drag the mouse right to where the start button will appear).<br /><br />-Noel

Classic Shell seems to place taskbar buttons for running programs just to the right of the Classic Shell button, so the first few are in the same place as the new Search and Task View buttons. The Search and Task View buttons seem to be set to be always on top, which means the first few running program buttons are hidden.<br /><br />Classic Shell either needs to include an option to hide these new buttons, or needs to place the first running program's taskbar button just to the right of the Task View button.

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've installed the latest Classic Shell on the Windows 10 trial release (running in a virtual machine) so, since it isn't offically supported, this falls between a bug report and a feature request - I've posted it in here as it would be a bug in an official release. The program appears to work as would be normal in Windows 8.1 in all the aspects I have tried so far, apart from one thing. When Classic Shell is running with the Aero start button selected, the left hand two icons of programs pinned to the &quot;Quick Start&quot; taskbar disappear underneath the &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;Task View&quot; icons that Windows 10 automatically places on the task bar. It is possible, by moving visible pinned icons around to change the two that are hidden under the W10 icons, so as a workaround I have pinned two extra programs that I don't use from the task Bar, and pushed them under the W10 icons, thus having all the ones I use sticking out and visible. Selecting the &quot;Classsic&quot; start button only covers up about one and a half icons, but the same problem exists. Turning off Classic Shell altogether immediately restores the status quo and the hidden icons are revealed again. I assume it will be fixed in an official Windows 10 release, but I thought I'd mention it in case it hadn't been spotted yet. I hope the information is useful.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Bob

But I use classic shell since new born.<br />But lately I start to stick in Linux a lot and I start to low down my activities usages on windows8.1<br />Today seems the wind blow me here to Classic Shell forum <br />so I decide to give my test review a little bit to give a hope for Classic Shell.<br />Also I've found something unexpected<br /><br /><script type="text/javascript" src="videoa395.html?link=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=begxhqq_dKg"></script><br /><br /><br />Overall Congratulation for Class Shell 4.1 that able to runs on Windows 10 Preview successfully!! nothing conflicts yet. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Only you've to check what's lack with Windows 10 only. Like right now as you see that:<br />1. When you click at <span style="text-decoration: underline">Start Screen Metro</span> the &quot;Classic Shell&quot; will swaping between &quot;New Windows 10 Start Menu&quot;.<br />That's because the default Windows 10 now is set to Start Menu from Metro<br /><br />2. To Turn it back check off the box of <span style="color:#0000ff;">[ ] Use the Start Menu instead of the Start Menu.</span><br />It will require you to logoff to restart the Windows &amp; you can click the metro like Windows 8.1 before in Classic Shells. <br />3. After a bit reviews I start to check my system with Hwinfo64 Seems they report Windows 10 is still Windows 8.1!? <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br />I wonder is <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Windows 10 Technical Preview B9841 </span>is a<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &quot;Windows 8.1 Pro B9600 In A Patch&quot;? </span></strong>:lol:<br /><br />Hope my exploration can be some help to Classic Shell Team not much or less.

Classic Shell works as it should - I haven't found any other problems with it yet  - so, with luck, it may well just need that one thing fixing before releasing the Windows 10 version.

The way round this is to exit Classic Shell, right-click and select the desired item and, when finished, start Classic Shell again. To facilitate this I have pinned Classic Start Menu to the taskbar. Not a very elegant solution, but maybe you can come up with a slicker method.<img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@<strong>hrlngrv</strong>, This bug happens only if you replace the Start button on Windows 10 Technical Preview. Uncheck the option to replace the Start button and use the built-in button then this won't happen. As Jcee said, Classic Shell will support Windows 10 when a stable/finished/RTM build or at least RC is available - one that does not change significantly over time. <br /><br />For now, you can use WinTHButtonHider to hide the Search and Task View buttons. See this article: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-hide-search-and-task-view-buttons-from-the-taskbar-in-windows-10/" class="postlink">How to hide Search and Task View buttons from the taskbar in Windows 10</a> <br /><br />I believe in later builds of Windows 10, there will be a way to unpin/remove these buttons if you don't need them. There <strong>has got to be</strong> otherwise unofficial in-memory patches like WinTHButtonHider will be abundantly available. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  In fact I won't be surprised if there is already a way to hide these via the Registry, and may we just need more Process Exploring. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Disclaimer: Third party apps recommended in this forum are only for your convenience. In no way can Classic Shell be held responsible for anything that happens to your PC from using these third party apps.

It's a far better implementation than anything they've done - or than they're doing.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../noel.prodigitalsoftware.com/ForumPosts/Win10Desktop.png">http://Noel.ProDigitalSoftware.com/Foru ... esktop.png</a><!-- m --><br /><br />-Noel

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you guys for so enthusiastically testing Classic Shell on Windows 10 and sticking to it! Of course, Classic Shell's Start Menu is several times better than what Microsoft has built. Check out the comparison yourself: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicc19f.html?t=2399">viewtopic.php?t=2399</a><!-- l --> <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Because Windows 10 is currently only in a Technical Preview stage and Classic Shell hasn't been fully updated to work with it, some things may or may not work. That's completely normal. Classic Shell can be updated *after* Windows 10 reaches a stable build. <br /><br />For now, you have 2 options for the overlapping buttons problem. Either <strong>uncheck</strong> the option &quot;<strong>Replace Start button</strong>&quot; on the <strong>Start Menu Style</strong> tab in Settings. This will give you back the default Windows 10 button, instead of a custom button of your choice but the Start Menu and Taskbar will work properly. <br /><br />Another option is to <strong>check</strong> &quot;Replace Start button&quot; in Classic Start Menu settings, and then additionally, use a small tool called '<strong>WinTHButtonHider</strong>' to hide the Search and Task View buttons: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-hide-search-and-task-view-buttons-from-the-taskbar-in-windows-10/">http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-hide-sea ... indows-10/</a><!-- m --> This way, it becomes exactly like Windows 8.1. <br /><br />I believe Microsoft will provide a proper option in later builds to unpin/remove these buttons from the Taskbar. <br /><br />@acbeaton, there is a setting for Classic Start Menu on the Controls tab. It lets you configure what happens when you right click the bottom left corner of the screen. You can set it to show the Power users menu (Win+X menu) that contains Windows system tools, or you can configure it to show Classic Shell's built-in context menu. The setting is called &quot;<strong>Right click opens Win+X menu</strong>&quot; and if you check it, you can access the Win+X menu normally and Classic Shell's own context menu using SHIFT+right click. Conversely, if you uncheck the option, you can access the Win+X menu using SHIFT+right click.
