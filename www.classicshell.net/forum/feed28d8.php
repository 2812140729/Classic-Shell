Ciao loekf<br />Thanks for the reply and want to thank you and everyone else for coming up with good thinking to manipulate my solution. Snowden. . . is the world that small, really? <br />Can’t believe I said that!<br /><br />The greatest remedy for anger is delay. -- purple monkey dishwasher<br /><br />Was surprised to get so much feedback in such a short period of time. Well, passion worth more than paycheck – only guessing. Don’t ask, don’t tell! Me lazy bone &gt; next time I will read more what other people wrote about similar topics instead of asking such silly questions. My apo-polo-logy to wast your time. Keep up the good stuff/work!!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=656">JaHu</a> — Mon Jul 01, 2013 6:22 am</p><hr />

Ill be honest. I consider myself to be a smart person and I feel a little lost...<br /><br />What happened to the purple monkey dishwasher?<br /><br />When did the time continuum get corrupted?<br /><br />Why did the T-Rex in Jurassic Park walk onto the tracks by the SUV's but later the SUV fell of a cliff? Was the T-Rex levitating in the first scene?<br /><br />PS: I just disabled the start button on Classic Shell and that seems to work okay. Check out some of my other post to see what I mean. And yes, Windows 8.1 still sucks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=938">fresnogamer</a> — Wed Jun 26, 2013 7:04 pm</p><hr />

Windows Blue will be out soon. . but Mr Classic Shell (ivo) is on a trip around the world. His cell phone is buried in his backyard. What evarrr. . . I am elsewhere and up for a ride - explore space both inner and outer. . . . . <br />oket this may not be the best scenario and I do not know Mr Classic Shell at all - even thought, he must be a smart guy who has a lot of potential. <br />There are lots of ways to go about it, but <br />my problem is that I rather trust this man than Microsoft. 6 million downloads is a statement. Even do Microsoft <br />claimed that it has sold more than <em>100 million Windows</em> <em>8</em> licenses. They had to admit that people do appreciate a <br /><em>start</em> button and want to use it.<br />lately, I attended a meeting where we discussed <br />guidance for training standard regarding Win8. Some of my colleagues and myself tryed to include Classic Shell as an recommendation in our papers. <br />To understand how to create real trust, you first have to understand what <em>causes distrust</em>. In one word: fear.<br /><br />So. . my question is, what if <br />a <em>piano fall from the sky</em> onto <br /><br />Mr Classic Shell<br />walking<br />down the road (knock on wood)?<br />Is there a plan B for the worst case szenario (e.g. it will be carried on as an OpenSource project - <br />without serious risk<br />)?<br /><br />No long talking. . . ehh sorry about that &gt; but I guess you get me!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=656">JaHu</a> — Tue Jun 25, 2013 8:43 am</p><hr />
