Even a built in shadow.<br />Like those winding snakey worm creatures.<br />Looks like many days of hard work, doing layers as well.<br />Good to see alternate menu skins, being made:)<br /><br />I gather .xcf is a Gimp file?<br />I wonder if it's a good idea to upload a CSM backup XML configuration file?<br />That way we can have it set up the way you have it. Can the XML file be used on another computer?<br /><br />The only big kinks that I see to be ironed out, are the submenu bottom padding or slices is wrong amount.<br />Looking at submenu bitmap 400 by 412. Slices add up to 430, instead of 412. That's an easy fix.<br />The name text location is a bit off as well. Something odd with the cutting off of the center rod.<br />I'm sure you know these anyway.<br /><br />Got to say, hope this gets more skinners to come forward with their own.<br />Does take patience and time though, as I'm guilty of lack of those, these days.<br /><br />Bye

(Honestly I dont like using fancy themes and such) I usually stick to solid colour/minimalistic/functionalist style. Ive just always wanted to make a nice sc2 button, and then I liked it so much I made a skin to go with <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br />Not sure what you mean by cutting the center rod?<br /><br />And thanks for the tip on the submenu. I threw the .skin file together in like 20 mins so i figured there would be some errors to iron out.

I think what has happened, is a layer in Gimp was moved slightly,<br />making a dark transparent line. That may be your intent, I don't know.<br /><br />Good job with the buttons.<br /><br />I should have zoomed in closer for the picture.

I may eventually pick it back up or even include terran/protoss variations, but I doubt its worth the effort.<br /><br />As for new skins: there are a few reasons I havnt been 'churning' them out. I havnt had much free time lately, they take quite a bit of time to perfect. and they are likely not worth the effort, especially for niche skins like this (I would estimate no more than 5 people are actively using this skin)<br /><br />The main reason I did it was to see how it would turn out.<br /><br />As for a star trek skin; if you can supply the texture I would be willing to add it to a skin and adjust the padding to make it fit. (assuming you have photoshop skills) This offer goes out to anyone who wants a skin and is willing to make the resources, but simply lacks the knowledge on .skin files

Aswell as any features you would like to see added. Ill try to make use of some of the new features to allow a less stretched look, but I may have to re-make some of the resources from scratch for that.

Ofc thats prettymuch re-making the entire skin <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> and I might as well do a terran variation instead (it would probably get more use as it would go well with any generic metallic or space theme outside of the starcraft universe)

I  laughed at you saying neversoft because I used to play Tony Hawks pro skater 3, it was one of my favorite games back then as well.<br /><br />Is it supposed to be a .skin file? Or a .skin7 file? I changed the file extension, and it seemed to display properly on both. The skin text was black though. You can add icons to both the left and right side? I didn't know that. I also didn't know of the emblem aligning options , like left1 or left2. <br /><br />Awesome work! ^-^

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, I agree with the nameplate idea. Also, the idea about the queen of blades wielding a sword that skewers the nameplate I think is a very cool idea as well. <br /><br />If you did a .skin7, there's a bug with the jump list, and search pane. When you do a search, or hover over an item for recent programs/files in the 1st column, emblems disappear on you, and the column 1 stretches to accomodate your jump list or search query items. Column 2 seems to be missing, along with your emblems you made. Should I make a bug report?<br /><br />At first I thought that the 'help and support' button 2 images up had a custom mouse hover select image for when its selected by the mouse. So I thought, you can make custom selector images for the start menu? But I'm not sure if that's possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just kinda stopped working on it <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (Im not a personal fan of themed start menu's, I did this to test the limits of CSM) the latest version (zergmetal3.skin) should be attached to one of the post. Though I've had quite a bit of free time lately.. I might fix a few of the odd bugs like the user-image.<br /><br />[Update: heres a few potential portrait borders; Im probably going with the plain square (images2), However If you agree that this would make a good kerrigan replacement I might go that route, because it looks cool]<br /><br />[Update2: This looks quite awsome, but I'd have to remove kerrigan (atleast when the user picture is present)]

I think i might too actually (I don't wanna get rid of kerrigan), but it needs a more zerg-like border (a shiny chrome ring hardly fits this theme) but maybe that doesn't matter because its just a transitional element?<br /><br /><br />It might be possible for me to include a 'fake' user-image by adding a setting that allows the user to include an image. The user however would have to format it properly to fit (IE round the edges, and make it the exact resolution needed) but this wont be clickable.
