		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks, Gaurav; I'll check my firewall settings. However, unless Classic Shell itself changed the settings on my computer AND my wife's computer, the settings allowed Classic Shell to access the Internet just moments before the update. That's how I knew to download the new version of Classic Shell: because the Classic Shell update page told me there was a new version, and I downloaded it from there.<br /><br />Anyway, I've been using Classic Shell for several years now, and I've always successfully downloaded new versions and installed them over the old versions. Should I, with this latest version, have uninstalled the older Classic Shell first?<br /><br />Edit: This is an hour or so later. I added Classic Shell Update as an exclusion to both my Windows firewall and my Norton Antivirus. No dice. Same problem failing to check for a new version. Then, I found a forum response from a year or two ago with people experiencing the same problem I'm now seeing. It seems that at the time it was a bug in the program, the program not building a certain folder for updates on one's computer that it could read. Ivo responded with a newer update that worked at the time.

Check the NTFS permission on that file or its parent folder(s). Usually, they should not get messed up on their own but major Windows 10 in-place updates and the way Windows migrates the entire data to the new installation does sometimes cause screwed-up permissions on some directories.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Success! Thanks, Ivo and Gaurav.<br /><br />Now, since I have your kind attention, another, possibly unrelated question: I've been using Classic Shell ever since the introduction of Windows 10 several years ago. But ever since the Creators Update I've experienced an odd behavior. About every third or fourth time I boot-up, the start menu is frozen. I have to go into the Task Manager, click on Windows Explorer, and restart it. It only takes a moment and everything works fine thereafter, until a few days later when I reach the third or fourth boot-up and then I find the start-menu frozen up again and I have to restart Windows Explorer.<br /><br />Do you know if this behavior is related to Classic Shell and Creators Update or just to Creators Update?<br /><br />John

They were not checked, but they weren't unchecked by me because I didn't even know the update file existed until you suggested looking at it. Anyway, after allowing the read-write permissions, the Classic Shell update works fine.<br /><br />So, I followed your instructions for recreating the DataCache.db file. Then I restarted the computer a few times, and by the third or fourth restart (using &quot;Restart&quot; the first times and then completely shutting down the computer the next few times) I got the Start menu freeze up. It seems almost random. Restarting Windows Explorer, as I've said, restores Start menu functionality and takes only a few seconds, but it's an annoyance. Otherwise, the whole Start menu is frozen (I can neither left nor right click it). And, as I've also said, it began happening immediately with the installation of Windows Creators Update.<br /><br />Finally, how do I use the capture tool during bootup, esp. when I don't even know if the freeze is going to happen? (It's not a reliably repeatable freeze up; it doesn't happen every time I boot up, just every third or fourth or more times.)<br /><br /><br />Edit: I recreated the DataCache.db file a second time per your instructions. I've now restarted the computer six or seven times, and it restarts fine. Maybe the eighth time the Start menu will freeze; who knows? For now, good enough.<br /><br />Thanks for all your suggestions.<br /><br />John

It might also cause it. A restart may not be required to trigger the slowdown.<br /><br />Although even when placed in the Startup folder, it may not be enough to catch the slowdown in a dump because Classic Start Menu loads very early at startup when Explorer.exe loads (so the freeze might happen BEFORE the procdump runs to capture it into a dump). In that case, uncheck the option &quot;Start automatically for this user&quot; in Start Menu Settings (General Behavior tab). This prevents the Start menu from loading automatically at startup.<br /><br />Then start the dump capturing program and immediately load the Start menu manually by running:<br />C:\Program Files\Classic Shell\ClassicStartMenu.exe

It worked fine for about four restarts, and then I'm embarrassed to say, the regular Windows 10 start menu froze up before it had even loaded Classic Shell. I say &quot;embarrassed&quot; because apparently it wasn't Classic Shell at all that was causing the start menu to randomly freeze but something in Windows itself.<br /><br />I thank you again for all your help, and I'm sorry for the trouble you've taken to advise on a subject that turns out unrelated to Classic Shell. Still, it's nice to know you're working with a great product in Classic Shell. I don't know how people use Windows 10 without it.<br /><br />John
