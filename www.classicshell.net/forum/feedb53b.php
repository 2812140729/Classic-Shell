<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8435&amp;p=35764#p35764"><![CDATA[
DARKMATTER-SUBSPACE Revived [7 style] opaque for CSM 4.3.0<br />Exactly for 96dpi/100%, 120dpi/125%, 144dpi/150% sizes. <br /><br /><br />This is a ported start menu from a theme by Hyperdesk &quot;The Skins Factory&quot;. Only the black version, not the alloy one.<br />I never knew about this until somebody tried and failed to port to Classic Shell a few years ago. <br />His Resource Hacker file went corrupt. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />My turn to try. Looking on the internet, Hyperdesk made XP, Vista, Win7 versions. I picked Win 7 version, for use on Win10.<br />The two biggest effects that can't be reproduced are there is no text glow available in later Windows OS,<br />and CSM does not use menu image pasting to build up the size of a submenu. <br />Example; The intentional noise texture of original submenu will just stretch and distort in CSM submenu.<br />I used a technique by making the submenu image gigantic to fake the look. That's one of the reasons why skin file is so big.<br />That default submenu is only good for displays up to 1080 vertical though, so I guess only good for 100%/96 dpi.<br />I don't have a Hidpi display to know what it would really look like. <br /><br />The menu never had user picture, but I put in option anyway. <br />Oh yeah, CSM can't have a jump view with white text, and search view with black text, as in the original menu.<br />Has to be both matching, as the text color is shared for both views.<br />If only I knew more of undocumented text from Ivo. <br />Example: an arrow in search view, uses text as &quot;List arrow&quot;, but if the arrow is a bitmap, the text changes to &quot;Search arrow&quot;.<br />There does not appear to be any way to have correct search arrow size when using classic styles with 125% size.<br />No point crying over spilled milk. <br />Anyway, I had to make an all white, or all dark jump/search view option.<br />I added a black button selector, and submenu brightness options made from the explorer part of the theme.<br /><br />There's one thing about the original menu. Wow, so much wicked color banding at the top bar. <br />I had to spend time dithering to smooth out those brightness steps. Mostly gone now.<br /><br />That's about it.<br />Crossing fingers for no big text errors. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Probably my last black ported menu skin. <br />They always look great, to begin with, but never fit in with the rest of Windows, <br />as most of Windows is based on white.<br /><br />I added a start button, taskbar, and wallpaper in the zip.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you to <br />the people at &quot;The Skins Factory&quot; that have made very impressive themes. Superb artists.<br />Looking at their site, they don't specifically make Windows themes anymore? <br /><br /><br />Note:<br />If you want the first column a little skinnier, go to the &quot;Main Menu&quot; tab in CSM settings.<br />Adjust the &quot;Programs pane width&quot; &amp; &quot;Jumplist pane width&quot; to 30<br />To get the flyout cascading submenu, there is an &quot;All Programs style&quot; setting under the same tab.<br /><br />Final note: If you want icons on the second column, <br />I added extra skin file to get basic Classic 1/2 styles. <br />It is not like the original XP menu, for I reused same 7 style bitmaps<br />User picture will always be inside.<br /><br />Warning <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> BIG FILE download <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><br /><br />EDIT: Changed picture to show 100% size<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> â€” Wed Apr 25, 2018 12:03 pm</p><hr />
