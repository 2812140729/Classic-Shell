'Ello,<br /><br />I've been toying around with styles and came up with a decent one. However, I couldn't find a decent start button for it. So, I decided to shake the rust off my hands and make a button after having gone so long without making any [mind, I was never very good at it, lol]. Either way, here it is. I've included the .xcf files in case anyone here might want to make their own edits. The picture shows it as being slightly misaligned, however, for some reason that actually makes it work a bit better [doesn't really seem misaligned when it's actually being used either]. This was made with a small taskbar in mind, so if you want to use it on a small taskbar, setting the size to 0 should work fine. However, I haven't tested it on a large taskbar.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4140">Nimbi</a> â€” Sun Jul 24, 2016 7:28 am</p><hr />
