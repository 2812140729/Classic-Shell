The things we could adjust from Advanced Appearance fall into two categories: one that applied to any theme - including those with visual styles and ones that applied only to the &quot;Classic&quot; Windows theme which wasn't based on visual styles. With Classic theme itself removed in Windows 8, some parameters have no effect. Someone in the community needs to make a list of all the things that are still applicable and can still be adjusted. Like icon spacing etc or window borders which are all definitely still changeable. Then maybe someone can write an app. Of course, it won't go into Classic Shell as it has a policy of original features based on its own code only, no registry tweaks. Registry tweaks can break across Windows releases and do break far too often in modern versions of Windows.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Fri Mar 22, 2013 5:32 am</p><hr />

First I'd like to say thank you for this nice little piece of software, which saves a lot of time.<br /><br />Is there a chance to get something like windows7 advanced appearance menu and functions into Classic Shell? Like TinyBorders from WinAero and some of the other preferences, e.g. icon spacing etc.?<br />And getting the explorer toolbar customised would be another great feature <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />oh and wait: if there will be a solution - like it was on XP - for getting the accurate directorysize displayed in an explorer window without installing any other fat software, I'd call you master!<br /><br /><br />many thanks,<br />heartOG<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Fri Mar 22, 2013 4:51 am</p><hr />
