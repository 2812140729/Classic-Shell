Sorry.<br /><br />looking at the Nintendo menu pictures, <br />I can see that there are all kinds of textures and pictures in the menus.<br />I don't think CSM can do that kind of stuff. <br />From what I learned so far, can only have pictures, or texture in the corners. <br />Everywhere else will be stretched, or shrunk. <br /> <br />Looks like Windowblinds uses a different way, of jigsaw puzzleing the parts together, <br />and then repastes to build up height and width. <br />This avoids stretching.<br />Probably Vector graphics too, but really don't know.<br /><br /><br /><br />Wow. You triggered my memory from XP days, way back.<br />I used to have Windowblinds. There was some kind of animated dragon on top of the menu.<br /><br />Just went to their site. <br />They have encredible skins.<br /><br /><br />Can't you just use an updated version of Windowblinds, <br />and try their skin studio, to fix the bugs/os changes?

Tried two times. Gave up. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <br /><br />Strike 2.<br />Searched my room, and found old dusty version Windowblinds ver5. Installed on XP. Tried your files. There is some corruption, maybe are for v6 or above. Dang it. There is no SkinStudio on my $24.99 disc, to try. <br />Website just takes me to upgrade, only $9.99. Cheaper now. But not again. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />Ball 1.<br />I see a skinner, Vampothika, has a SkinStudio tutorial slide show, over there at Stardock. <br />The program looks as sweet as honey. Very visual, and easy to understand. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Strike 3. <br />Saw your posts over there. They don't want to help for legal reasons. The names and characters are prized by Nintendo.<br />I'm no lawyer, but see their point. If I recall, even Ivo had to change the start button, as MS complained about it.<br />So big companies can ask for take down, or worse action. Unless Ivo puts more options to include more floating pictures, <br />like the user image, I don't even want to try, even if files sent personally. The menus would look very incomplete. <br />Making anything round is prone to big time jaggies, especially outside of corner areas.<br /><br />For those reasons and more, <br />I'm out. Sorry. Not the end of the world.<br /><br />You can still play. Even if people on forum over there, don't want to help, they still said you can to do it on your own, <br />and not upload it. With help from tutorial, I can tell, you are smart enough to geter done. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />I don't get what you are saying about getting the colors right? Is it the xp classic menu, Nintendo themes, or something else?<br />If it's Nintendo themes, I can change the color tint of say the sunshine yellow menu to any color, in Windowblinds old version.<br />If it's xp classic, meet you over there, on that topic.<br />If it's something else, I donno. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br /><br />ps I believe there are lots of skinners with CSM. They make for themselves or companies, but don't share.<br />Got a feeling though, in some cases, when one closes account, all gets deleted.

May not look good if menu text names are very long, or short.<br />If you want to have the power button isolated at the bottom,<br />go into &quot;Customize Start Menu&quot;, drag 2 to 4 of the &quot;custom&quot; item commands,<br />and drop above the shutdown item. This will clear some space in between.<br /><br />I hope I'm not offending the original Pixtudio artists.<br />They made some great skins back in yesteryear.

Thanks Stardock.<br />To make texture not distort, as the menu changes size, even HIDPI,<br />I added a black noise tile pattern for bottom, and right border.<br />I used a diamond tread tile pattern for the second column.<br />The way I got the gradient on them, was make the edge gradient on the red and green mask, <br />fade to black. Which makes it more transparent.<br />I made the background on the main menu image black with a grey edge line. <br />So when the mask gradient fades away to black, the look gets darker.<br />The grey line will show some of the masked pattern too.<br />Don't know if this is the correct way to do it. It works though. <br /><br />I put another flat grey tile pattern option if tread pattern isn't your thing. <br />It will still follow the edge gradient of the mask.<br />For creature comfort emblem, it can be turned off as well. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

And I was serious about wanting to compensate you for all this.<br /><br />Also, I don't see an &quot;extend bottom padding&quot; option for the Metroid skin. How could I add the option?

Just position it right so that a shutdown button without a text label can be shown there, and when it's selected, it should in theory select the blank label too, appearing normal. I guess there's a way to add that as an option, because user pictures can be added as one--but I know nothing about skinning Classic Shell... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><div class="quotetitle">juniper7 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I'm torn between my electronic hobbies and skin making.

I'll have to tone it down a smidgen.<br />The submenu will have to be plain, because tile texture can't be applied to submenus.<br /><br />Don't expect too much. To me, this StarFox menu does not look as good as the other ones.<br />I'll put an option for user custom image, to swap out to a different space image.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Resurrection of Stardock's StarFox skin is finished. Classic 1/2, and Win7 styles. Have to use CSM v4.3.0<br /><br />Various problems with this skin.<br />The scanning lines create havoc with text, so &quot;text shadows&quot; option can help. <br />To get sharper text, change &quot;Font Smoothing to &quot;Standard&quot;. <br />It is not original background picture. It had to be modified to work with CSM stretching menu. <br />Due to patterns are not available on submenus, there is a choice of plain background, or sudo tile pattern.<br />Sudo will compress, and look weird at times. <br /><br />Menu skin can work on 96 DPI, or 144 HDPI. Not for 120 HDPI, as elements go out of alignment. <br /><br /><br /><br />I put an option on classic style two column, to use extended bottom padding. <br />You need to load the xml file along with setting up the two icons. <br />Put the folder &quot;StarFox Bottom padding xml&quot; in drive C. Don't hide in another folder. <br />Put skins in Classic Shell skin folder. <br />Load the xml file, and it should switch to StarFox classic skin, with the icons at bottom.<br />If you want to use a different skin, load the other xml file to get back to normal(without customization}.<br /><br />Menu skin only comes with one background picture.<br />There is an option to use another background picture. <br />The screenshot shows a couple other examples.<br /><br />There are many wallpaper sites with pictures to use. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://wallpaperswide.com/">http://wallpaperswide.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You will have to crop them,<br />as most of what we see on the menu is top left of a bigger picture.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why are there incredibly tiny selection buttons for extended bottom padding setup? <br />When xml option switches to icon button(without text), and if no icons are selected, guess what?<br />The selector reduces to just a few pixels high. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />For some odd reason there is some interaction between 1st and 2nd columns that make selector bigger on 2nd.<br />So I took advantage of it, and put fake icons behind the semi transparent selectors. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Also, in past skins I used a custom blank item to push the above text out of the way. <br />It does not work when no icons are selected, and since Stardock made original separator as invisible padding,<br />I use a bunch of those to make buffer space above.<br />That's why no visible separators in second column, when extended. <br />I had to make the separators brighter to offset the scanning lines interference. I don't use them, as they get in the way.<br /><br /><br /><br />Last thing. <br />StarFox's Mama said, &quot;Never look at the sun. You will go blind&quot;.
