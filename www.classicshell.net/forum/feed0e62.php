ok so i always loved the windows 7 theme with the aero lok. while i havent been able to figure out a way to give the taskbar a blur and be transparent to replicate the aero look windows 7 has, this program only seems to have a one or the other sort of deal going on. ive managed to get everything else though. and i thought id share.<br /><br />so i noticed u guys had some start buttons, but when used on my windows 10 home edition it has out of size and position. and there was also no black theme. now i didnt have the originals to work with so i used photoshop to make as good of an edit as i could given the circumstance to make a dark version. anyway i hope this helps some of u guys out. ive also included the relevant taskbar skins for u. its actually the vista one which was also the best i could find.<br /><br />Edit: took a few times to figure out how the attachment system worked here. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=30504">karnage</a> â€” Sat Feb 03, 2018 3:49 am</p><hr />
