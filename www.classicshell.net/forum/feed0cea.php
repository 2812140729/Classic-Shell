By &quot;Start menu on one taskbar and open window buttons on another&quot;, do you mean that you have multiple monitors? That's the only way I see two taskbars. In that case, a combination of 7+ Taskbar Tweaker and multimon software such as Actual Multiple Monitors/DisplayFusion can help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Fri Mar 28, 2014 12:17 pm</p><hr />

I wouldn't like Windows 7 without classicshell, and I'd almost consider using windows 8 with classicshell, without it, never. I put classicshell on every computer I use and I will continue to do so as long as possible.<br /><br />Windows 7 is now more customizable than windows XP, which is a refreshing change to the trend that microsoft has been on. <br /><br />For the task bar, this is probably beyond your scope of work, but if I were able to put the start menu, system tray, and quick launch on one task bar and the &quot;window buttons&quot; that show which windows are open on another, that would be awesome.<br /><br />Also it would be sort of cool if you merged some features from Windows 7 Taskbar Tweaker in to classicshell (i.e., disabling jump lists and those annoying popup window preview images); I think if you did that it would make classicshell the complete package to get back the features that windows 7 has removed. <br /><br />Also in explorer it would be great if I could get rid of the &quot;organize&quot;, &quot;share with&quot;, etc. bar (I don't need it), and be able to move the address bar and back/forward buttons around vertically so I can put the window in this order: title, menu bar, classicshell toolbar, then address bar. I don't understand why Microsoft decided to change the order of those menus for 7<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Fri Mar 28, 2014 11:46 am</p><hr />
