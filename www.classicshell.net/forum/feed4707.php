Well, you can't expect every program to have every feature. If you found other software that has some useful features, then go ahead and use it.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2016 7:44 pm</p><hr />

I found a neat little program that remembers the locations of your icons if they ever get out of order.  Its called DesktopOK.  Let me explain why that feature would be awesome:<br /><br />Every time I updated my video drivers for my 2 video cards in SLI, I have to go into the settings for the cards and re-enable SLI.  When I do this, the screens flash, and then all the icons are garbled on one side of the main monitor.  Since I already have this program running, it would be nice to have a feature that would re-position your icons back to where they were without having to have a separate program running and using ram/processes.  <br /><br />Another feature that would be nice to have added would be one that remembers each window's position and size.  As of one of the previous windows releases, they removed this feature.  You can get it back by yet another program called, &quot;ShellFolderFix&quot;. Unless this particular feature is already here and I just don't see it?<br /><br />These two features would be awesome to be implemented into one handy program, ClassicShell.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13904">BLzNFuN</a> — Tue Jun 21, 2016 7:20 pm</p><hr />
