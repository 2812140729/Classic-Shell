Can someone give me a shout when I'm there? <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br /><br />But in all seriousness...does that actually happen? Do usermade skins ever end up being included in future releases of Classic Shell if they're good enough? And if so...what are the criteria?

I don't think it is possible for every combination.<br /><br />On a recent upgrade skin clearsharp1 7 style, I managed this: <br />main left menu -black text on white background<br />jump list menu-black text on left white background, and black text on right light background<br />search menu -black text on light background<br /><br />and <br /><br />main left menu -black text on white background<br />jump list menu-black text on left white background, and white text on right dark background<br />search menu -white text on dark background<br /><br />Confused? I am <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br /><br />About the rounded cornered button.<br />Just the shutdown button with big round corners. <br /><br />The option for the other buttons nice. The original are ok when small. On main menu, the indent gets stretched too big.<br />What would happen if the stretching slice pixels start higher, keeping the indent same size? <br />Later, no really later tonight, if I have time, I want to try inverting button image. <br /><br />Stone arrow with its shadow, is better than default, but has chunky edge.<br /><br />Submenu, maybe give extra 1 pixel padding around edges.<br /><br />About including a user skin.<br /><br />I worked in QC dept in telecommunications industry for more than 2 years. <br />Criteria is probably similar for any product.<br />Are all known bugs fixed?<br />Does it pass testing and visual inspection.<br />Does it pass all safety etc.<br />Most important in lean manufacturing,<br />Does the customer want it? <br />Pulled, instead of Pushed.<br />Including that dark colored Metro mod would be good. <br />Stats show there is demand for it.<br />That's a &quot;Pull&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />The High dots per inch in CSM options can run independently.<br />Set to 120 and 144 for regular 125% and 150% increase, if default is 96 <br /><br />I have to go bye.

Because going off of the concept this menu was based off of, it seems the plan at the time was for it to be in the left column, as shown here:<br /><img src="../../classicshell.net/forum/https_/djcityboy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/lh_aero_demystified.html" alt="" /><br />Is that okay with you, or is the right column a must? Maybe I'll add both, but if I'm not able to...well...that's why I'm asking.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Honestly I'm pretty rusty at CSM skinning...it's been quite a while since I seriously messed with Classic Shell, as I've been focusing more on a menu application of my own design, Start9:<br /><img src="../../classicshell.net/forum/https_/i.imgur.com/yC7AEe7.html" alt="" />

So I'm not sure what having the pic in the left-hand column looks like. I am used to the Windows 7 menu which obviously has the pictures at the top right. But the main reason I would like that option is because with the way I've set my menu up, there's just the right amount of space on that side to have it at the top, and I just think it would complete it for me. Like I said I'm just getting into Classic Shell so there's probably a lot I'm not aware of. I mainly got it to change my start button but have been exploring all its features and very happy with it... this is the only thing I feel it's missing.
