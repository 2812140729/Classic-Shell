		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First, I love the fact that Classic Start Menu is now the easiest (and cheapest!) way to customize the colors of the taskbar.<br /><br />But, I use the &quot;Windows 7 Basic&quot; desktop theme on Windows 7, and if I choose to &quot;Customize Taskbar&quot;, but pick the exact same colors as the theme gives me, I noticed that I lose the 3-D effect at the top of the taskbar.<br /><br />If you could add an option to pick a color to use for the 3-D effect, that would be awesome, but even just not painting that part of the taskbar in the custom color would be great.

Or, can someone make a visual style that looks and works exactly like Windows Classic? Would that make this work?
