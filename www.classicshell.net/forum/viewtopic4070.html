		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi everyone,<br /><br />thanks for the new release. Unfortunately, something appears to be wrong with it. Since installing, I have the beautiful Windows 7-Style start menu but the pinned items (upper part of the list) are gone. I can only see the list of recently started programs. There is no horizontal separator bar either.<br />When I right-click e.g. Outlook in All Programs --&gt; Microsoft Office --&gt; Microsoft Outlook, it offers me to <span style="text-decoration: underline">unpin</span> the icon from the start menu though... so Windows still seems to think it's pinned but the Classic Start Menu is not showing it any longer.<br />I have skimmed the options and reset them to defaults, to no avail. Changing to the other start menu designs also has no effect, the pinned icons are gone.<br />Any idea on what I can do besides reversing to an older Classic Shell version? Does anybody else suffer this?<br /><br />Regards and a lot of thanks!<br />Joe

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By default the Windows 7 style uses a new Pinned folder to store the pinned programs. It is empty by default.<br /><br />You have 2 options - if you have any interesting programs pinned in older versions, they will be in the Start Menu folder (currently will show inside the All Programs list). There is an option to show the Start Menu folder on the main menu like before. In the Main Menu tab change the &quot;Pinned Programs folder&quot; setting to &quot;Use Start Menu folder&quot;.<br /><br />If you don't care about your old pinned programs, pin some new ones. Right-click on a shortcut and select &quot;Pin to start menu (Classic Shell)&quot; or drag the shortcut to the start button, wait for the menu to open and drop the shortcut inside.

Actually I was using Classic Explorer before but not Classic Start Menu (because for now, I feel the Windows 7 built-in start menu has all I need).<br />Well, we all will be forced sooner or later to move to Windows 8, so I better make myself at home with Classic Start Menu, too It's the first thing to be installed on Windows 8 to give that blasted OS some use at all.<br />Thank you for your efforts. The results are just amazing!
