Is it possible to increase the font size of where it says how many items are in a folder &amp; the size of the total files there. I drew green arrows that point at them.<br /><br />Thanks

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for the suggestion. I tried messing around with the DPI settings and noticed that just increasing it one notch (from 100% to 125%) increases the size of a lot of other things just way too much. It would've been nice if Microsoft programmed that setting for me to put any number I want (for example 103%). But things get way too big.<br /><br />What you said is such a great idea! Can you please mention this to the Classic Shell programmer to integrate that option to increase the height of the status bar, and the ability to increase the font size (and maybe change the font type) within the application itself?<br /><br />Thanks so much!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Alright, so I messed around a bit again with all this. I noticed that I prefer to keep the DPI at exactly 100% since that is what is shown as accurate (for example, when I want to type a document, I want to see its exact size before printing it; I don't want to see it enlarged on the computer and notice that it's actually small when I print it). <br /><br />I've actually temporarily fixed this in the past, yet reverted to its small size again because of other conditions. As a matter of fact, I found exactly what can make that font bigger (I'm using Windows 8.1):<br />Right click Desktop -&gt; Screen resolution -&gt; Make text and other items larger or smaller -&gt; At the bottom, select Tooltips &amp; change that font size. That is the exact option to change the font size for what I want to change in that picture above. Yet I use a program called Media Player Classic a lot (it's an audio/video player) and the thing is that in the bottom of that program, the word &quot;Playing&quot; gets enlarged and the bottom of the letters &quot;y&quot; &amp; &quot;g&quot; don't show. I don't like how it shows that, so I revert back to the smaller font so the whole word is visible.<br /><br />So the only resolution is if Classic Shell can implement the feature we were talking about earlier. It would be so great if that's possible. Thanks

I had Version 4.3.0 previously, and never noticed it there, either, but then I wasn't looking for it at the time. That font adjustment would be a big help, as my vision is pretty bad, so maybe I'll have to downgrade to 4.3.0. I've backed up my settings to XML files, so it shouldn't be difficult. If I can't find the option in 4.3.0 I'll just upgrade again.

Unfortunately, the Windows 7 color scheme dialogue doesn't offer a separate setting for the status bar, which seems to use the same font as the menus. I'd use a larger font there, but it messes up the overall layout. It gets even worse if I increase the DPI; some items don't fit properly.<br /><br />However, I was able to change the system font in the registry from a barely visible MS Sans Serif 9 to Tahoma Bold 9 without messing up the layout too much. Your file conflict dialogue seems to use the system font, so if I hadn't changed that, it would be very hard to read the dialogue.<br /><br />Thanks for your help, Ivo!<br /><br />Edit: Oops -- I was wrong; Windows 7 uses a smaller font for the status bar than it uses for the menus.

I had already discovered that through experimentation, and by adjusting the tooltip font I was able to improve the status bars of many other apps besides Classic Explorer.<br /><br />A few of my apps don't respect system settings at all, so they're unaffected by tweaks. In fact, some of them bypass the system font altogether, and do not provide adjustments of their own. My current global system font is a substitution in the registry to eliminate the use of MS Sans Serif, but some apps manage to ignore what's in the registry and use what appears to be 8 point MS Sans Serif. I'd get rid of them if they weren't so useful.
