I had the issue of it not installing (it brought up a very quick command prompt and that was it), which I later found out to be the virus. I then downloaded the installer again from another mirror and it installed fine into my other drive (Z: drive). However, I didn't enjoy the program too much (just a personal taste thing) so I uninstalled it. My question is as follows: will anything on my 2nd drive (the Z: drive) be infected? I already have done a clean install of windows on my C: drive and am running a virus/malware scan on both drives as we speak. My Z: drive contains all of my steam games so it its almost 1TB of data I do not want to re download. Is the Z: drive potentially compromised, or did the hack only target the boot file in the C: drive?

If you haven't rebooted since then though, there is a good chance your MBR is busted and you will have to follow the repair instructions like this: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic9c1d.html?f=22&amp;t=6440">viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=6440</a><!-- l -->
