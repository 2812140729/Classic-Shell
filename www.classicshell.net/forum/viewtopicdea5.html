		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi meetHG. Yes, in between jobs now. Life threw me a curve ball. That's all I want to say at this point.<br /><br />Your version .3<br />Say what?<br />You are the first person to try those text strings in that fashion.<br />Does that mean text strings could be used for labeling on menu as well? <br /><br />I did not look inside the skin file, but I can see what you are doing. <br />In order to get the jump-list/pin items on right side, you flipped the paddings,<br />forcing the left to right, right to left. No idea why 1 pixel makes a difference.<br />Past a threshold somewhere. <br /><br />Are you Jewish? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This reminds me of using Hebrew language. It flips everything horizontal.<br />Hey, some idea for you. Use your first version, edit the language file at the Hebrew section to English words? <br />I think it should switch automatically?<br />Make sure to save a copy of original language file to put back afterwards.<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I just tried it.<br />Shucks, Using Hebrew language does switch column positions.<br />Just one big problem. It draws right to left. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />It puts the icons, arrows on wrong position, and reverses some images.

If there is, this can be used for labelling tile text titles.<br /><br />Nope. I'm not Jewish.<br />I tried your idea of changing language.<br />And As you said some results were good some were not.<br /><br />So, Question is still up to debate. <br />Might we need Ivo's help as I don't have a single idea why this is happening. <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />Bye.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi.<br />I know you are not Jewish, and either am I. Your new version menu has the look <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> of those 8 languages that are read right to left. <br />Personally I like the start button close to the action items (search, programs). <br />I recall Gaurav has some technical name for the ergonomic operation, of what I am trying to say. <br />I remember people have asked if the start button can be moved further towards center of taskbar, but I think it was no. That would be great though to match this menu.<br /><br />By putting the paddings in not so normal ways ( like a double jointed person),<br />It's like telling menu to bend over backwards <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Does it work differently on older version of CSM?.<br />I remember some problem that showed up on a newer version of CSM. I reported it.<br />When Ivo fixed it, he said something about it not parsing properly. <br />Maybe that is what a true bug is called.<br /><br />Many skins I have made, I get weird anomalies. 99.99% were my fault, because I don't understand the logic, or forgot about some text further on down in file that overrides it.<br />I've come across a couple in updating XP Classic Retro 7 style skin, just recently.<br />If the user name is set to italic (slanted font), parts of letter at the beginning / end of name get cut off. Only certain letters though. It's like CSM does not read the outside letter boundary for italic.<br />If I switch to normal font, all is well. Either I messed something up in file, or really is a bug? <br /><br />Another weird one with user name, and user image outside at same time. The main padding overrides the main2 padding or User image padding in a weird way. Forcing Main2 padding won't work. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br />If I turn off user name, main 2 padding is ok. In the end I had to make a work around,<br />by having a different User_image_padding=4,67 instead of user User_image_padding=4,8,<br />only to do it when user picture, and user name checked together. <br />Win 7 style does not have user name option, so I am pushing CSM in contortionist ways, so I don't want to report it.<br /><br />Up to you to report your padding oddity as a bug, or is there a work around?<br /><br />Bye.
