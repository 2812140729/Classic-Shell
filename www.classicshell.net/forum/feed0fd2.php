Thank you, I was frightened to uninstall as I didn't want anymore problems, my PC has been a bit unstable lately, but now I have fixed everything, so this is the last fix.<br />I will try the utility and completely uninstall it and reinstall the old version  3.6.8 again, and hope that this fixes the menu button overlay and the video bleed through problems.<br />Thanks for all your help and support guys, this little program rocks my world and every PC I set up gets it as the first program install.<br />without it I wouldn't know where to start with all these rubbish window 8 and 10 tiles. grrrr.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21349">Andy.Smalley</a> — Sat Aug 12, 2017 3:28 am</p><hr />

The start button popping on top of video will be fixed in the next version.<br />If you are getting different menus for a mouse click and for a Win key, check the Controls tab in the settings. Make sure both settings are set to the same option.<br />I don't know about the rest - the start button shouldn't be changing on its own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Mon Jul 03, 2017 8:31 am</p><hr />

Can  anyone help me out  please?<br />I  have been running Classic shell on my PC for the last 3 years with no issues,<br />I love the program and have installed it on every PC I have configured since finding out how fantastic it works.<br />But recently I had an issue with my Comodo internet security that forced me to have to a remote desktop with one of their gurus.<br />The guru, completely reset all the views if my Windows 7 Home premium.<br />He managed to hide all the  Classic tools icons that appear in all the windows, I have now got these back but the icons are larger then they were, that is my first issue.<br />The second issue is, whenever I play a video online the start button pops through the video when in full screen.<br />My third issue is, when I press the windows start button with left mouse button, I get the vista start menu with 2 rows, this is not what is selected, but if I physically press the windows start button, I get the correct XP style single start menu.<br />Also I have noticed that the start button sometimes changes is appearance? I have an old version from 3 years ago and the start button is a plain START, with no graphics, but sometimes it comes up with a start button with graphics.<br />It is all very strange.<br />What I want to know is can anyone help me sort out all these issues individually, or should I just uninstall it and reinstall, my problem is if I reinstall will it remember my prefs/settings and just return back to how it is now rather then returning to how it was?<br />Alos I could use &quot;my uninstaller pro&quot; that will remove all traces of installation, including all registry edits.<br />Sorry for the long winded post but I would love to get this all sorted as it is really messing with my brain.<br />Thanks in advance<br />Andy<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=21349">Andy.Smalley</a> — Mon Jul 03, 2017 1:06 am</p><hr />
