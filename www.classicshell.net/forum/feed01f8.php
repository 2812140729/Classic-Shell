So we tend to even leave bad review's rants.

I don't see how to move posts. I see the mod options, but all I can do is delete, edit, and warn. For now the point is moot anyway, since you guys moved all the threads that originally triggered this post. Don't see much else to do now, but I'll keep a lookout.<br /><br />Also, do you have a policy on moderating posts? For example, <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/mcp.php?i=reports&amp;mode=report_details&amp;f=12&amp;p=26988" class="postlink">this post</a>is reported because it's &quot;spammy looking.&quot; I agree that it's not very helpful and it doesn't look like he even read the replies, (and that's his only post for some reason) but then again, it's not <em>un</em>helpful. Do you want me to &quot;give warning&quot; in those cases, or what? I also see you've edited some posts. Is that for clarity/grammar, or what? Do you want me to do that too to give you less work? Or would you rather me leave that kind of modding to you guys? I don't want to do anything you wouldn't approve of, but I don't want to ask you before I do anything either since you might as well do it yourself in that case.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3392">Weboh</a> — Wed Oct 26, 2016 3:56 pm</p><hr />

OK welcome to the forum, Weboh <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Here's how it's currently organized. (Feel free to move posts if you feel they are in the wrong forum.)<br /><br />Announcements subforum has all posts related to new releases or any critical news like the hack in August 2016.<br /><br />Tutorials subforum has Tutorials.<br /><br />Classic Start Menu and Classic Shell 4.0 beta forums have mostly Start Menu related topics.<br /><br />Classic Explorer forum has Explorer related topics.<br /><br />Classic IE has Internet Explorer-related topics.<br /><br />ChitChat is general discussion about anything else not related to Classic Shell.<br /><br />Of course, certain topics which go into &quot;Feature requests&quot; or &quot;Bug Reports&quot; can be put under &quot;Classic Start Menu&quot; or &quot;Classic Explorer&quot; as those features or bugs are about them.<br /><br />Start Menu skins mostly contains topics asking for help on skin creation or finished skins.<br /><br />Start buttons contains button images.<br /><br />The following threads are global announcements:<br />- Official Thank you thread (because we don't get enough of them unless it is global) <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />- Start Menu Comparison (because we have fierce competition)<br />- Explorer toolbar icons post (could only get people to stop asking about why some toolbar icons are missing after it was stickied)<br />- Forum Rules (people keep asking the same questions repeatedly.)<br /><br />In addition to this, each subforum has certain topics stickied or pinned to the top because those are the most frequently asked questions or something that we feel must be read by visitors to get the most out of Classic Shell. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> People keep asking about them if they are not pinned.<br /><br />I agree there's scope for improvement <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I feel people don't visit the Start button and Skins forum enough - they can discover some gorgeous Start buttons. They don't use the Classic Explorer features enough, especially some powerful toolbar commands they can add. They don't use some of the Start menu features which are buried inside like Search providers, or the Turn off monitor command or managing wireless network SSIDs via the menu.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Tue Oct 25, 2016 9:02 pm</p><hr />
