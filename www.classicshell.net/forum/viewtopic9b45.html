The text area is enlarged, the borders are preserved, and stay the same.<br />That special Win XP skin I made for you, had enlarged borders for HI-DPI to stay in correct proportion.<br />I think it got moved or deleted. I don't see it anymore.<br /><br />Does the Metro skin really have 4 numbers for the vertical slices.<br />Either I modified it by accident, or it's real.<br />Maybe that could be used to have a value set for the bar to expand in HI DPI automatically?

That would take time to do.<br /><br />I could put in the offset picture for standard English setup, <br />with a couple extra sizes for different 2 column width.<br />It would look quite funny when it does not match up. <br />It will either be more towards center, or outside of menu.<br />Come to think of it, having a picture half outside the menu in Win7 must have looked odd at first, <br />until we accepted as the norm! <br />Ah shucks, even changing the font size option will change user picture position. <br />That would mean user bitmap as regular middle, 3 position reg corner, 6 more for other font sizes,<br />plus the same again for 150 HI DPI equals 20 user bitmaps, and it still won't be perfect.<br />Like Jcee says, goes exponential. Bad idea. I'm stuck in the mud.

To leave big empty space up there, or make extra text modifications to fill in menu, when option not selected. Almost anything is possible. <br />I would need more than 1 request to do it, for it take lots of time on huge variation skins like this.<br />If lots of people want the plain look, I will gladly do it, when time allows. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Had time to make the plain menu option, for only the Classic 2 column.<br />The one without the gradient bar on top. <br /><br />Once that bar is gone, a few menus looked exactly same as other menus. Same menu color, same selector color.<br />So I altered the color on those duplicates. <br /><br />&quot;Black, and Blue&quot; menu without bar, turned into powder blue. <br />&quot;System Glass Color Transparent bar&quot; turned to whole transparent menu. <br />&quot;Warm Day&quot; has gradient bar on selectors instead.<br /><br />The skin is revision D. It's at the first post. It should still work on older CSM versions.<br />Forgive me if I made a mistake somewhere.<br />Dealing with qty 255 bitmaps can be a bit confusing. Do I get a Creamsicle when it hits qty 500? <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Just let me know if something is not right.<br /><br />I just added a light pink variation with powder blue selectors.<br />If you want pink colored selectors , use Resource Hacker to go into skin file.<br />Go to &quot;SKIN&quot; folder 32 and follow the instructions that look like below:<br /><br />pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink <br />pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink pink <br /><br />;Remove the &quot; ; &quot; FROM THE SIX LINES BELOW TO GET PINK SELECTORS.

Can't read text.<br />I never tried adding the glass drop shadow feature, that Ivo added some time ago.<br />That might help in text visibility.<br /><br />It's kind of like other unusual setups, usually made by mistake, that look cool at first, just mostly useless for a menu.<br /><br />Like where the menu, or/and selectors all invisible, with just the text visible. <br />Just make menu bitmap a few pixels in size with overly large slices, <br />so program draws the few pixels, and the rest is drawn invisible.<br /><br /><br />One other transparent oddity was making a semi transparent 7 style skin.<br />Say if main menu bitmap is 150/255 alpha. <br />If the scroll bar bitmap has alpha 150 or higher, everything works as usual.<br />If the alpha on scroll bitmap is below that 150/255 alpha,<br />the desktop behind shows through.<br /><br />I like the transparent feature Ivo put in the inner programs 7 style Metallic skin. So it does not end up as just a rectangle.

Which is why it was never included before.<br /><br />Anything higher than black 0/255 will increase the brightness of it drastically, <br />whether on the selector 24 bit bitmap, or if additional glass mask is used. <br /><br />Never figured a way to darken, or did I, and forgot?<br />The old picture does show the dark bottom 3d edge. Hmm. <br />Well brain cells now dead, and unrecoverable now from fireworks and celebrating last night.<br /><br />I find it too distracting at lower opacity. I have mine set to about 70.<br />Gives it just a hint of randomness.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi,<br /><br />I'm new here <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I've been using Classic Shell for a long time (practically since the beginning), and I've finally decided I wanted to make it more &quot;XP like&quot; (in its stock form, it's close enough for the most part, but I wanted to try to get it as close as possible).<br /><br />So, when I decided to search for skins, I came across this. The blue and white, in particular, is a very good match to the menu from XP x64 (including the Caption). However, a couple slight adjustments were needed:<br /><br />*First, the caption and caption text were more-or-less like stock in terms of padding and such, so I adjusted those via Resource Hacker to bring it closer to the real thing.<br />*Then, I adjusted some of the padding for the selection highlight, as there was a one pixel gap between the left edge and the caption. Real XP doesn't do that.<br /><br />So with these changes, I went ahead and also replaced all the icons with their XP-based equivalents (where possible) and used an XP start button. Now, I have probably the most perfect XP Start Menu replica I've ever seen!<br /><br />Here are the settings I used:<br /><br />Caption_padding=5,3,2,6,100% (changed from 3,3,3,12,100%)<br />Main_padding=0,3,3,3 (changed from 2,4,3,3)<br /><br />Very minor, but it made all the difference!<br /><br />Thank you for all your good work!<br /><br />c

I want the My Documents and Network Connections icons to change with the currently applied theme. I know it's possible to do, because if I change the &quot;command&quot; from &quot;user_documents&quot; to &quot;user_files&quot; the icon changes to the current themed one. The same if I change &quot;network_connections&quot; to &quot;network&quot;. But I don't want either of those folders--I want My Documents and Network Connections. Is there a way to change the icons separate from the command or jerry-rig something?

Or you could add the option to use &quot;System Glass Color Full&quot; as the menu color to the &quot;Color Picker&quot; skin.

It's really hard now,<br />so I don't want to spend lots of time to make anything really complicated.<br />Adding that color picker into the already complicated large skin,<br />is too much for me. Believe it or not, those Retro skins Classic 1/2 skin rev D,<br />and the new 7 style rev B skin, even have a hidden bland glass blur option. <br />Just set to System Glass color Transparent bar, and turn off Top bar/band.<br /><br /><br />When I have time, I will add the glass menu option to the small color picker skin, as the bitmaps are setup already, <br />to use the red 255 (very bright) mask. <br />Doing a quick test. See picture (Win 10) of only blue glass color menu, <br />with rest of colors still custom color.<br /><br />The simple color picker skin is not like a real XP menu,<br />where highlight lines are set by system. Example R.O.B. skin <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="download/filecfd0.php?id=3966">download/file.php?id=3966</a><!-- l --> <br /><br />Only just an approximation. So those lines will look too white when using a dark menu color.<br />I would have to add an option to subdue the highlight lines for dark menu color like black.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I'll wait a week or two, in case someone else wants to do it, better. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Okay. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Can the Retro Color Picker skin have all its default colors set automatically to the System Glass Color Full values (top band, menu color and selector color) *when the colors are not customized*? As I understand, currently they are set to &quot;Windows Standard&quot; colors. And if they are customized, the custom values override the default. Also, a 3D search box+shutdown button as well? (since that option isn't there in the Color Picker skin at all but is there in the Classic Retro skin).

I had a few of those.<br />I remember one disk drive on Windows 7 had just certain areas of drive with the damage. <br />Win7 os would try to fix it, and make it worse each time and get stuck at the bad spots.<br /><br />I eventually used Win 98 floppy to check for the disk errors, and it showed me where the non fixable bad blocks were. <br />I then formatted the drive with the bad blocks section as non formatted partition, so Win7 would avoid that area. <br />End result, worked for a number of years.<br /><br /><br />Switching to quiet, mildly warm, and fast solid state drives, <br />was the best computer upgrade I ever made. I bought 4 ssd so far.<br /><br /><br />I'm working on adding the white view menu to the big 7 skin, and jump view option with a lighter color(not white), too. <br />It has got to be the most complex skin now. Very easy to make mistakes, and not know about it till later. <br />With my lack of logic skills, it's total chaos inside the skin file. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />Maybe another week to finish it off.<br /><br />The small color picker skin comment that I put, was to kind of bait you!<br />I figured since you made those other skins, you might want to go for it.<br /><br />No problem if you don't have time.<br /><br />Good to read from you.<br />Bye.

It would all be done with masks and a whole lot of text.<br /><br />Sorry I did not finish adding white search to the big 7 skin. I got bored and went back to making simple Star Trek skin.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I added a separate simple color picker skin for classic 1/2 styles. <br />It is in the &quot;XP Classic Retro rev D, E, Picker.zip&quot; at first post.<br />Similar to what Gaurav asked, but not combined.<br />It came out to what I thought it would be. <br />It is near impossible to just have one skin, to be all types of skins. <br />There would have to be multitudes of options to accommodate all types of colors, <br />brightness levels on different elements, which would lead to dead options that don't do anything, in a lot of cases. <br />Custom color options don't carry over too well for different looks, due to lack of my understanding of how to use various default true color hex numbers, for different variations. <br />To get exactly a classic look, better to use the big variation skin.<br /><br />I gave it a shot anyway. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />The Classic opaque variation is good if you want to tweak menu color a little bit, <br />like say mimicking the light blue menu color tinge of Anixx's screenshot from another post. <br />That has green on the band: R181 G212 B180, with the menu color: R210 G213 B215<br />If you make anything with strong color, you might want to click on the &quot;Highlight lines reduced&quot; option, <br />so separator lines are not so contrasty white. <br /><br />When using the glass variations with a very dark menu color, it might be hard to see the classic look dark selector. <br />In this case, turn on the &quot;Selector with light border&quot; option.<br /><br />Made for Windows 10. It should work on 7 &amp; 8.1. <br />Will probably have to adjust the glass color/brightness settings in CSM &quot;Menu Look&quot; setting for those OS.
