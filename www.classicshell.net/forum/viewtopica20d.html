Forums built in search functions are usually lacking, and the best way to search is usually google.<br />I know most forums keep all their old post, there has to be a better way to navigate/organize. There are alot of post/topics not likely to be relevent/helpful to people in the future that could be trimmed off.<br />The buttons section could have a pinned post, with instructions on installing, links to other button resources, info on creating custom buttons, and possible a conglomerate of all the custom buttons.<br />Also maybe buttons should be catagorized into 2 catagories : <br />themed - anything starwars/ect based on something other than a button...<br />classical (unless you can think of a better name) - anything entirely designed to be a button, with no particular theme at all. some examples would be the vista start button, the metro button, ect...<br />classical would probably be on top, as there more likely to be used <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />is there an easy way to allow users to delete there own post, even after it has been replyed to? and/or a way to allow the creator of a post to moderate his own thread? (give him power to delete post, but not ban?) If so i request these features.<br /><br />If you guys need help moderating i would be glad to help <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />

Few people in different time zones can do a good job in keeping the spam out.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@Tenzen<br />so you actually think a post that brings absolutely nothing relevant to the topic to be important?<br />Some people dislike users who browse a forum without the intention of posting/becoming a member because they feel they are just using it. Yes they are using it, but does it harm the forum for them to-do so? nope, it just doesn't help, compared to them joining in.<br /><br />Forums can really be used in 2 ways, 1. Living/experience, that you get to know people, and make friends. or 2. as a powerful archive of questions and answers...<br />some people from group 1, dislike people who use a forum as a tool, because they feel they are just using it as a tool, instead of caring for and nurturing it like something that matters...<br />personally i want to maximize accessibility to those people who don't have time to read 10 pages of information, <br /><br />and i agree with you about the irrelevancy of time, when it comes to posting Usually. although a lot of forums frown upon necro-posting. Even if the original poster isn't around to read your answer, someone goggling around will likely find it, and receive it. Unless that post is irrelevant <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, in-which case it just drags up old dust..<br /><br />as a user who is there, as a thread is unfolding its a lot easier to get through 20 pages over the course of a few days/weeks/months, and you can even give input to the conversation<br />but as a user who stumbled upon a post that's over a year old. that's a lot to read to get the information you need. Having efficient, and easily accessible information reduces the chances of that user needing to post on the forums asking a question that has already been asked. giving the forum users more time to respond to new topics.<br />@ &quot;someone might read them and decide we were nice people....&quot;, it is always a possibility, or they could become frustrated looking through the stuff that they would deem junk (not of interest to them) and decide TO &quot;blow up the planet&quot;. yes i took the alien reference out <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, and if by some random turn of events I am responsible for mankind's demise, so be it.. its not like i did it on purpose <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />*I'm curious, if when your searching for an answer to something your working on; if you actually take the time to read every forum post completely through?, or just skim page after page until you see something your looking for?<br /><br /><br />I think that a fully developed topic should be trimmed of personality, because all it does in my opinion is bloat down the relevant information, and increase the chance of Irreverent necro-posting.

We can decide what to write and what to say in life. We dont need an online communist regime re-arranging discussions to conform to agendas &amp; propaganda <br /><br />What you are doing when you delete someone's post is dehumanizing them, telling them they are not in fact capable of making intelligent decisions, and that you, are actually smarter than them, and have a better way of thinking.. which, yes, we all know is a common line of reasoning with people creating websites across the web who somehow think they are not only smarter than everyone on earth because they can use DOS, bust better and tougher too.<br /><br />I dont think many people can argue that your average forum moderator's personality works tirelessly to portray himself to be an equal mix of Albert Einstein &amp; the Incredible Hulk<br /><br />it plagues the internet users of the world<br /><br />All power corrupts.. Absolute power corrupts absolutely... and miniscule forum power corrupts people into miniscule megalomaniacs. time and time again<br /><br />and the one thing they all have in common, is that they abuse their power.<br /><br />they arent smart.. not even approaching intelligent by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />they just think they are, and so they abuse &amp; molest the minds, welfare, rights, dignity, and efforts of others<br /><br />they mostly are lacking in basic manners and social graces.. I suspect they never make it out of the house. time and time again they show they have no concern for others, no respect fro anyone but themselves and like-minded twits, and no empathy or understanding of anything at all..<br /><br />and this is a new site.. it has yet to begin here..<br /><br />but seems to have begun..<br /><br />I'm sure there are many readers &amp; would be mods who's spine is tingling and whos teeth are aching reading this post, wanting it deleted.<br /><br />but get over it... grow up... get a personality...<br /><br />who knows how you will do, I suspect not much better. much as anyone else given any sort of power over even the tiniest of things in this life, of which mods are the quintessential example <br /><br />but then, I grew up in a world before the moderator came to be. I remember the first moderators.. sent out to protect the image of larger corporations as they were beginning to tackle the wild rough &amp; free world that was the internet. <br /><br />and i recall how quickly that changed to the modus operandi for every single site on the net, where there was power to be wielded and excuses to be made for it<br /><br />I Call it over-moderating.  <br /><br />The internet has always been a place for empathetic &amp; interested readers &amp; scholars.. though it seems overrun by selfish kids with ADD and no concern for anyone or anything but themselves<br /><br />and just as alot of open-source or freeware software developers try to rope people into their websites and reading their information etc, as a small price to pay for their hard work, so too do people posting wisdom in forums expect the reader to care about the writer and the conversation enough to read through it, rather than just popping in and taking info, and running away with it like a fruit ninja.<br /><br />i think mature-minded people can read through the existence of what is, as it was created, as its always been on the internet, and in life.. the world and all of its inhabitants do not need to tailor to the teenage megalomaniacs with ADD on Ritalin with the attention span of a turnip<br /><br />Speed reading is an obtainable skill for all.. as is skimming..<br /><br />pages load in microseconds, and ya, I do skim through a hundred pages of conversation in less time than it would take me to find the same information in a bookstore.<br /><br />if people get frustrated, then, imo, they need medication, counseling, or psychotherapy, not a world that conforms to their disorder.<br /><br />and beyond those 2 ways u mentioned, is the third way, how one can read the internet by the people who made it, not the mods who edited it.<br /><br />and I for one would be much more interested 50 years from now to see how people thought talked, &amp; interacted than in whatever info i might trying to be looking up.. and i'd have nothing less than contempt for the moderator who took that away from me 50 years ago<br /><br />anyway. thats my own freedom rant..

For example, someone who is greedy, seeks power so he/she may fill their thirst for money..<br />and i don't believe all moderators are bad, its simply the bad ones stick out far more than the good ones.. in my opinion moderation in general is a step forward from the spam/advertisement filled internet we would have without it.<br /><br />@'post are rarely random'<br />Although it is true that most post do have some level of coherence to the original topic.. people often go off on tangents, or unrelated/personal discussions, that aren't particularly helpful to everyone else reading the topic... and some topics in general don't really relate to the general populace (this entire thread for one <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />), since most people visiting this particular forum aren't  here for the community, but to find answers as to why this or that isn't working properly. There are plenty of forums better suited to un-moderated discussion. than a help forum designed to help users quickly find the answers they need.<br /><br />@people posting to waste space; yea i would agree that most of the time there not, however a lot of post do in my opinion 'waste'space after they have served there purpose..., and once the thread has received a response, your post cannot be removed, except by a moderator.<br /><br />@shaping the agenda; i have no intention of deleting post that conflict with my viewpoint on a particular topic...<br /><br />@definition of moderator: that may be the definition, but the only reason the term moderator is used, is because that was the original design/intent of the system for admins to get assistance,  not all tools have to be used in there intended ways. but yes it is a stretch of the word, but then again words evolve...<br />I've had some bad experiences with some moderators to... but what they do is usually in the interest of what they believe to be right (except in some cases, where people do stuff just because they can)<br /><br /><em>all this being said, and how strongly you feel on the topic, i think ill take my moderating a step back <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.</em><br />also most people think they are at least above average intelligence <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.., when logically only about half of us are, its human nature to believe they know better than others whats right/wrong, and resist change..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, for sure I think you're a pretty good guy, but I've seen good posters go from that to lunatic simply by getting mod powers<br /><br />@Power Corrupts: Power is usually sought by the corrupt.. thats true... but moderators have alot of power, and they continually abuse it.. there is no better example of this than <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/">http://www.stopforumspam.com</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Its a website started by a moderator, who wasnt happy with his powers to ban a user from one particular site..<br /><br />I myself have had moderators chase me around the internet.. ones who were offended by my calling them out on their abuses of powers and their violating their own forum rules and seemingly not caring at all for a moderate environment, but one which favors a particular View-point of long-time members/the site owners &amp; moderators.. alot of mods are mods on more than one site.. its pretty creepy to leave one site, only be harassed by the same guy on a different site.. <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/">http://www.stopforumspam.com</a><!-- m --> claims to follow US Title Code 47,230, but that code states you need a valid reason to a serious threat or other serious problem.. but that site has no transparency, there is no public record of the content of the post nor a reference to the thread.. nor a screenshot of the activity, nor anything but what is often a lie posted by disgruntled moderators abusing your private email address you entrusted the site with, to satiate his spiteful grudge against you...<br /><br />its a website created specifically by website moderators who are not content with banning someone from their own website for any reason they see fit.. (and they do ban for literally any reason they see fit.. even if they go against their own forum rules..).. so that they can take their personal vengeance against one user who may have said things that makes them feel dumb personally... and then, completely anonymously, and only using the APIkey of any random website, and making any excuse they want to, without offering their own email address, or name or any other pertinent information, they can ban any user for any reason across a large number of websites on the web. <br /><br />thereby, one single crybaby disgruntled moderator can defame your entire reputation &amp; ban your entire existence across the internet, giving you no recourse, and without offering any public record of the reason why, nor giving the banned user any notice, not knowing who, when, for what, or why he was suddenly banned from the entire internet.. <br /><br />and any moderator on the planet can ban an address across the internet on all websites using this service. its complete defamation of character, and completely illegal. there's no proof offered, no accountability, no transparency, and no notice given to the user they are covertly banning across sites<br /><br />its simply a tool for anonymous little internet forum moderators to abuse more people even further, &amp; even more anonymously... its created by moderators and reeks of their personality from top to bottom.<br /><br />The only negative thing one has to post in any forum is simply regarding the abusive activities of a moderator, or their abuse of power, manipulation of information, lie-creation, propaganda creation, unbalanced forum, misguided loyalties, or incorrect knowledge, and suddenly you're banned from the entire internet.. they can give any proof they want, any old lie, in total anonymity.. and dont even need to use their own APIkey.. <br /><br />a better name for that site would be &quot;whining-moderator-cybabies-of-the-world-unite.com&quot;<br /><br />I wonder which moderator, from which site, created that website.. it must have been one where he literally couldnt stand to see him ban a poster in one website for no reason at all, in a display of unbridled megalomania &amp; mini-che tyranny, only to see him posting in another site.. which threw him into a moderating seizure.. <br /><br />its a vengeance, a personal grudge, a complete embarrassment &amp; total loss of face, alot of hate, and a very deep insecurity, that caused that kid to create that site<br /><br />and all it does is serve other little like-minded dweebs who think their little forum power should extend throughout the entire internet. <br /><br />pathetic<br /><br />I stand behind every post on every webiste I've ever made in my entire life since IRC chat &amp; newsroom days before forums were even invented.. and yet my email has appeared on that last.. and all i've ever dont is call out injustices as I see them, and point out the Moderators own abuses.. which explains the entire thing, i suppose..<br /><br />its the worst degeneration to hit the internet yet... what they need to have is a site which reports the abuses of moderators.. and bans their website from the web<br /><br />thats way more in line with the intent of US Title Code 47,230 to create a fair &amp; balanced internet

I've only done this once few years ago for a post that used a lot of profanities and was calling for the death of all Microsoft employees. That's unacceptable<br /><br />Other than that, I don't care what you post. If I don't like it I would not bother to respond or even read to the end of your post.

Secondly the person you are writing the appeal to isnt likely the same person who put you on the list, so any kind of insulting/threats, will really reduce the chances that he takes HIS time to help assist you.<br /><br />sadly having an IP or email address thats from a foreign country (just about any country that does not primarily speak english), is likely to carry negative stigma to a lot of people.<br /><br />And yes most spammers do have thousands of emails, or can easily make more.., so banning by email is even worse than banning  by ip (atleast your average spammer, doesn't know how to change their IP <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) <br /><br /><br />also maybe you could make appeal directly to portableapps.com, be relaxed and courteous when explaining your situation, and remember they don't have to do anything, it's entirely their choice.  this way they may decide to completely stop using that banlist website, maybe for another one, maybe none at all (besides there own), to ensure only those deserving of a ban are banned.

meaningless anyway.. hence, right off the bat you are confronted by a site that is boasting of the emails they blacklist, yours included</li><li>You look around the site and you dont see any other reason for it being there but to tout email addresses, and you search harder and discover a way, through menu items, to eventually ask for a repeal</li><li>By this time you are foaming at the mouth at the wiseguy who would make such a retarded waste of space which seems to be very giddy about having blacklisted your email address which you've used proudly for 20 years, and is well known around the web</li><li>You find it to be nothing but slanderous, hazing, oppressive, underhanded, devious, and shrouded in hidden intent since nothing makes any sense on that site at all..</li><li>You know, then, by matter of deductive reasoning, that there must only be one use for this site, for people to destroy your online presence, out of spite, hateful grudges, vendettas, malevolence, and that you apparently have one or a group of creepy stalkers on the web who are actually moderators at some site you likely registered for for a day, posted an opposing view, and were immediately flamed, trolled, &amp; banned by the imbedded group of usual suspects / forum-mates.. </li><li>You look the site over high and low for a contact method, because at this point you dont want to appeal anything, you want to speak with the owner of the site and find out who exactly added your email to the list.. but there is no such email address to be found on the entire site.. for a site that touts banning email addresses, theirs is completely secret</li><li>You look to see what it takes to ban an email address, and so you click on &quot;submit an email address&quot;, and find it requires loads of personal information about the person being banned, that is likely never even to be found from actual spammers, and absolutely nothing from the submitter but any random APIkey</li><li>So you look for some sort of identity, any identity, of who may be behind the site.. and you find absolutely nothing.. 100% secret, hidden &amp; totaly anonymous.. as if it wasnt actually created by anyone</li><li>So you go back to that quasi-appeal option, which you already know is not really going to reach anyone worth talking to... and will probably end up in the basement of some unsuspecting mothers home who has worries about what her kid is doing down there all day, but doesnt have the heart to find out for sure... </li><li>So you tell that hidden-in-the-basement creepy little cretin exactly whats on your mind, still in disbelief as you're typing that such a site is even fathomable, and you tell him frankly, the site is slanderous &amp; nothing more than Defamatory, which is obviously illegal and nothing else, and you tell him to stop his little dorky illegal behavior and take your personal email address off of his retarded blacklist. the same as anyone would.. </li><li>Then you never receive any reply, ever.. then you go back looking for a way to hunt him down, and you by chance stumble across some obscure legal disclaimer at the back of the site that says if the request you sent him stated anything about any sort of legal problem, or legal issue, or stated any other sort of legal action, then your email address will never be removed and you will never be replied to</li><li>you are then left with no recourse...</li></ol><div align="right">-</div>its is SOOOOOO the typical moderator.. <br /><br /><br />its nothing but a big old troll.. a typical forum trap set up by mods and their cronies ... you find such little traps all over the internet, that are for no other reason than to ban users from their site, and to try and let them continue imagining they have something useful to offer the world, and are somehow in control of the entire internet.. which obviously has a few holes in it, and so they created this site where they can carry over their delinquencies into other domains and haze &amp; degrade &amp; defame you to their teeny tiny whits last end <br /><br />you know, Law is there for a reason. there is no &quot;threat of a law&quot;. the law is the law.. and there needs to be a justice if theres a law or else the law is meaningless<br /><br />and laws are made to protect people.<br /><br />and its precisely because there are numerous cretins who thrive on the misery &amp; oppression &amp; abuse &amp; manipulation of others that there needs to be laws, because their actions are such that they need to be punished, and if not by a law, then by the hand of the oppressed.<br /><br />its for their own safety &amp; protection as well.. a Lawyer is what is called when the Plaintiff or the one who has been wronged believes the wrong-doer should be shot in the head, but the one who has been wronged is a law-biding citizen or doesnt particularly think the issue is really worth the bloodshed, or the offender really worth the bullet<br /><br />thats why we have lawyers.. and why need them.. a &quot;Threat of Legal Action&quot; is something criminals say when they are about to uprooted &amp; weeded out...<br /><br />that isnt a threat...<br /><br />Sending you a photo of you in the mall creeping people out with creepy little stares from across the way, together with a bullet and a little note saying &quot;remove my email and pay me $50,000, or just pay me $50,000 by noon tomorrow, or your mom will wonder why the basement no longer smells funny&quot; is a threat.. obviously<br /><br />But its one or the other..<br /><br />I chose the legal, correct, and proper way to deal with people such as this, causing problems such as this<br /><br />in an ideal world.. there wouldnt be this kind of people who do this kind of thing.. but, reality check.. thats the way the world is.. chock full of little cretinous creeps

A lot of the information that is listed is gathered from &quot;honeypots&quot; setup to trap spammers. Being listed on the site doesnt mean you have been sending spam. The IP address that you have, mightve been inherited from someone that spammed, someone may have just used your email address or even that you have downloaded a virus or trojan. If you use the <a href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/removal" class="postlink">removal</a> page and be polite, then we can figure out what has happened and get it fixed.&quot;</h3><br /></blockquote><br /><h3></h3><br /><br /><br />to me that seems fairly polite, and decent of a request; i clicked the removal, page, but since im not on the list, it said i wasnt on the list, and i cant see any other page.. unless i submit my own name to the forums..<br /><br />the homepage is a slightly offensive, in the fact that it singles out email addresses and such. but one possible reason is so when someone issues a ban, they can confirm it has been added successfully. Also clicking a random 10 emails, i see that 8/10 of them had over 10 email addresses banned..<br />although 1 of them had 3, and the other had 2.<br />This is a small sample, and some legit users with heated opinions are bound to slip through the cracks.. but overall, it seems atleast 80% of bans seem to be spammers.., yes though they could have a system that removes 1 email address from each IP every 30 days, because the spammers create like 10 emails a day, that number would be insignificant, and not worth the spammers time to re-use that email anyways..., and would remove any legit people from the list...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3><blockquote class="editor">[h3]</h3><h3></h3><br /><br /></blockquote>[/h3]

(at least from my past experiences, he seems helpful and nice)<br />when someone gets heated there personality can change quickly. which is likely the case given his previous experience with moderators.. I think,he has a great deal of censorship in his own country, with 'the great firewall of china' and all.. (apologies if this is off, i'm not an expert on the subject)<br />and once someones on the offensive.. its not hard to want to go defensive, and take a hard stance against them, regardless of what is right or wrong.<br /><br />if your website is designed to only stop spammers, and not people with 'hot tempers' you should try to accommodate people with hot tempers, because in their situation it is a reasonable response, even if it isn't the correct one. Although it can be hard to give a whiner what they want, sometimes it is the right thing to do, regardless of personal opinion. Now if you had a specific section for 'livewires', or people you suspect to be easily riled up, that would be a different matter.. but it shouldn't be a category that is included by default when admins of website decide to use your list or not...<br /><br />Also even if he doesn't have legal grounds, he does have some moral grounds, and he has supposedly put a lot of work into earning a reputation around the web, on that email address... even if it isn't his personal name.. its still defamation of what he holds to be his identity.. as far as legality is concerned.. I'm not a lawyer so i wont pretend to be one... especially since you're most definitely more versed in the subject, having to deal with such threats, <br /><br /><br />somewhat offtopic: I believe ive read in some cases (of copyright infringement), that some courts have ruled an IP to be personally Identifiable, and thus part of their identity.

I can tell you right now a list of about 8 or 12 moderators who would love to have put me on that list because they personally hate me and have a personal vendetta against me..<br /><br />I'm going to guess the one who blacklisted me goes by the name &quot;Andrew Noseworthy&quot; and moderates &quot;Gzstuff&quot;? I almost knocked that kids head in in the real world.. I know him actually.. he's more afraid of me than anyone on earth.. and would love nothing more than to do something exactly like this..<br /><br />as would several other VERY corrupt mods in certain gaming forums.. and one media forum<br /><br />I'd appreciate it if you could tell me which one.<br /><br />I dont hold you personally accountable, I hold them accountable.. so long as I'm not on your site for something i havent done, I have no problem with you or your site.. but i would hope that other people are not being similarly abused by corrupt moderators through your site, and you should hope so to! and you need to make it so that cant happen, or your site will fail eventually<br /><br />so please give me the information, I will contact them myself and get to the bottom of this<br /><br />thanks for removing my name from your site.

I'm offering an alternative viewpoint.., i never once said he was a good mod/admin, simply that i haven't personally seen anything wrong with his website (not that its not there), other than the &quot;<span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">douche bag</span></span></span>&quot; remark. which you've mentioned worse in this thread about him. as you said i dont know the guy.. i just dont see your argument as objective, partially because all the emotion you have brought to the house; if you want to convince me, i need actual sources.. not just paraphrasing, because they are easily skewed.. <br /><br />however i do disagree with your sentiment that ALL moderators are bad guys, bla bla, and feel that the bad ones just stick out more..<br /><br />and @ anonymously; what internet are you on? the internet is far from anonymous  theres just little/no follow through.. because you know.. &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones.. but words can never hurt me&quot;; although i do wish you COULD be more anonymous. <br /><br /><blockquote class="editor"><blockquote class="editor"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="background-color:#a9b8c2;"><strong><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">[b]Quote:</strong></span>[/b]</span></span></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="editor"><blockquote class="editor"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#fafafa;"><span style="color:#4b5c77;">also defamation might be illegal here, but it isn&#39;t HIGHLY illegal.. its definitely not in the same category as rape, and murder... <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.html" alt="" /></span></span></span></blockquote></blockquote><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">its a Proper &amp; Legal response to something that should/could/might/probably would get someone hurt/injured/beaten/battered/hospitalized or worse</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">I&#39;m all grown up.. thats what grown ups do.. when I was younger, I&#39;d definitely think the other options were a whole lot better.. &quot;</span></span></span><br /><br />Im lost here.., all i stated is name calling doesn't fall into the same category as assault, rape, or murder..., not that it wasnt still against the law.

I'm sure you can find some likeable Communists or Fascists as well.. theyre not all bad guys... seriously..<br /><br />so, what you're saying is I'm a liar cause there is no proof?<br /><br />ya, I do think this conversation is over<br /><br />I've lived in a Communist country run by a Totalitarian Regime for a very, very long time.<br /><br />and there is exactly no difference in how they wield their power and how the vast majority of moderators wield theirs<br /><br />I mean, the internet has become the most oppressive, tyrannical, absolutely corrupt place on the face of the planet<br /><br />this kook, just like most every mod I've personally had experience with, is WAY worse than the world's strongest &amp; most oppressive Communist regimes...<br /><br />I dont really know how to explain it other than its born of holding power over others<br /><br />there's really no other explanation.<br /><br />you want to make your own little version of reality? just delete what was there, pretend it wasnt there, alter what remains, and then lie your little swanky butt off about really happened, regardless if everyone knows differently.<br /><br />that is modus operandi for practically every Oppressive Iron-Fist-Ruling, Mind-Controlling, Propaganda-Spreading Regime to have existed since Hitler.<br /><br />exactly, in every way, to what goes on in forums..<br /><br />I've spent most of my life being controlled &amp; manipulated, oppressed &amp; brainwashed.. I know exactly what it is, how it works, and what it feels like, and what kind of cretins are behind it..<br /><br />and I dont really care what your laws are or arent. i know whats what, and what becomes what, and what deserves what...<br /><br />and ya... it is Defamation... this is about the defamation, and abuse of power by mods..<br /><br />I am the last person on earth to give a crap about name calling, since I grew up when you could say anything you wanted to on the internet. anything at all.<br /><br />I'm all about the free speech <br /><br />I pointed out his potty mouth because his entire facade is dependent on his telling everyone else they are out of line and wont be responded to if they dont talk to him like he's anything but the little princess he thinks he is.<br /><br />and thats that.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />the internet is pure(mostly)... free-speech.. you're mad because someone chose to tell others that you were a spammer, those others chose to listen, by adding you (although not directly) to their ban-list. its their fault if they fell for the 'lie' or sacrificed some non-spammers to ban the true spammers more easily..<br /><br />If you want to say absolutely whatever you want, to whoever will listen, start your own website.., because although the internet itself is all about free speech, privately owned websites don't have to be.., in a sense what is tolerated on a board, reflects not just on the poster, but on the boards owner for allowing it to remain..<br /><br /><br />as for calling you a liar, i'm not, i'm simply stating i have no idea if you are telling the truth or not.. because i hardly know you either (although i still know you better than him)<br /><br />and yes i DID want to clean a few threads up, that went off on tangents not really related to classic shell..., because that is, and what this website should be about... but that was before i realized how strongly you felt against it...<br /><br /><br />As you suggested earlier, instead of deleting post, ill change their coloring/size to make them easier to discern/skip
