		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello, world.<br />I just joined this forum to ask this question.<br />I'm not sure it's a bug in the Classic Explorer software, but I believe so...<br /><br />First of all, sorry for the &quot;censorship&quot;. The pictures are taken from the work PC of my office, and I'm not allowed to share the contents.<br />Nevertheles I'll try to explain.<br /><br />The &quot;fig_1&quot; shows how I view the contents of most directories.<br />It's more or less what I wanted. The selection mode is <strong>not</strong> &quot;full row select&quot;, so I can easily select the files with long names, like I'm doing in the picture (the mouse arrow was not captured, but the light blue selection rectangle was, and four long-named files are selected...)<br />This feature is very useful for some works I usually have to perform.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some directories are shown in a different way: the example is in &quot;fig_2&quot;. As you can see, the files are represented much more spaced (very annoying, when there are a lot of them) - by the way, also the bar with &quot;Nome&quot;, &quot;Ultima modifica&quot;, &quot;Tipo&quot;, etc. is higher.<br />And the selection mode <strong>is</strong> &quot;full row select&quot; (making the work much harder).<br /><br />So, what happens in the second directory?<br />I have verified that it doesn't contain any special hidden files (like &quot;desktop.ini&quot; or similar), it hasn't special attributes nor permission.<br />It looks like the behaviour actually depends on the directory name.<br />In the &quot;fig_3&quot;, I have just renamed the &quot;buggy&quot; directory adding an underscore at the end (as shown in the title bar on the top and in the tree panel on the left - the address bar remained unchanged... a minor bug, maybe, but it's not so important). And now the contents of this directory behaves normally!<br /><br />Other notes:<br />All the directories involved have names consisting only in basic printable ASCII characters, without spaces or blanks... In particoular, the two directories shown in &quot;fig_1&quot; and &quot;fig_2&quot; have the same name except the last digit (that's why I chose them as example - but also some other directories behave irregulaly... maybe a 5% of the total)<br />Also if I change the name of the parent directory, or the name of the grandparent directory, the contents of &quot;fig_2&quot; become normal. So, the bug (if it's actually a bug in this software) depends on the full path name.<br />When the pictures were taken, the computer was running ClassiShell 4.0.2. Then I have updated it with the most recent version 4.3.0, but nothing was fixed.<br /><br />Can anyone help me to explain this behaviour, and (hopefully) get it to work normally?<br />Thanks in advance,<br />G.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Classic Explorer is only a plugin for Windows Explorer that restores *some* functionality. It does not affect the selection of any item in the file pane (right side pane).<br /><br />However, there is a way to do what you are asking for. You can try an app called Folder Options X: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://free-sk.t-com.hr/T800soft/software/FolderOptionsX.html">http://free-sk.t-com.hr/T800soft/softwa ... ionsX.html</a><!-- m --> It should let you toggle the behavior for *all* folders regardless of their names or paths.
