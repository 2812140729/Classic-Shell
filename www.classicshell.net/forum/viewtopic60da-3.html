		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Look at the right side area of the status bar (to the immediate left of where the Zone is shown). That area shows the combined size (like all past versions of Windows dating back to Windows 95).<br /><br />The information that is shown in the status bar when a single file is selected comes from the tooltip. Whatever the tooltip shows will be shown on the status bar. Starting with Windows XP, you can modify what the tooltip shows from the registry. You can in fact tweak everything in the registry in newer versions of Windows - what properties the tooltip shows, what properties the Details pane shows, what the Details tab in Properties shows etc on a per-file type basis.<br /><br />The status bar behaves like the Explorer status bar in Windows 95 to Windows Vista.

It is very dependent on the file type. Whoever implements the file type decides what goes into the text.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The size of the selected file or total size of all files in the folder minus subfolders is always organized in a section of its own. It does not show folder size at all. Cutting keywords can make certain users unhappy as every user has his preferences as to what properties he prefers to see. That is why the infotip is registry-customizable. You can remove what values you don't want to see for particular file types from the registry and add your own. Also, some infotip property values may be long, some may be short short, hence everything is shown in serial order, one property after the other, to make optimum use of limited available space. If the status bar were to organize it into sections, then there might be space wasted if the earlier property's value is too short.<br /><br />For example, if you go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\SystemFileAssociations\.jpg, you can see some values there and properties. Refer to this page: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144133(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144133(v=vs.85).aspx</a> and you can customize the Properties shown in the tooltip, details pane etc.<br /><br /><br />The zone will be shown as &quot;Local intranet&quot; for a network share if you uncheck &quot;Automatically detect intranet network&quot; from Internet Options -&gt; Security tab -&gt; Sites and then check &quot;Include all local (intranet) sites not listed in other zones&quot; and &quot;Include all network paths (UNCs)&quot;.

The first field is larger and is variable size because it can display variable text. The fixed-size fields are right-aligned. Some people may not like it but that's the convention.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In my opinion the total folder size seems far more more important than the size of only files directly in the folder. In-fact I think its also more important than space remaining on a particular drive (especially nowadays), and should remain visible even with files selected. Though because in its current implementation it matches XP, it would suffice to simply add the <strong>option</strong>, with its current setup being the default<br />@zone, wouldn't just the icon suffice for identifying the browsing location?, Also the steps to include a 'local intranet' zone seem like they have more effects than changing the zone in the status bar.. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ill just leave that be, as i don't really care for the zone information anyways... <br /><br /><br />@Cutting Keywords can make certain users unhappy: <br /><br />It could always be <strong>Optional</strong>... Though since those keywords are mostly file type specific.. implementation would be difficult.. so this suggestion can be ignored <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (unless theres an easy way to detect what is meta-data and what describes it)<br /><br />@Limited Space: Cutting keywords, and the text for the Zone fields would further reduce total space needed <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <br />I wasn't suggesting static sections, but rather dynamic separators that would simply be placed between the meta-data<br />a separator is equivalent to around 3 characters in space? compared to 2 characters in space currently being used (a comma, and a space) But I would consider the readability increase worth it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Here's some Ascii for; no-files selected, multiple files selected, a generic file selected, and a sample JPEG; in that order.

I would like that to change as-well (maybe with the same toggle as above)<br />And if possible re-implementation of the folders size in the size column for details view. (though this may be difficult/impossible)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />1) There is nothing simple about showing the total folder size. It can take many seconds, even minutes to calculate, and by that time it may already be out of date.<br /><br />2) As I said, I don't have any control over the tooltip text and I don't want to have control over it. It is between the implementor of the file type, the OS, and the user. There is a huge number of potential file types and fields. The OS already has a customizable system for displaying file info. I don't want to implement an alternative customizable system for displaying file info and be responsible for handling all possible file types.

The status bar shows harder to find info, like pixel size for images, version for DLLs, etc. It is a lot more useful than repeating what you can already see.<br /><br />Besides, all that is a moot point. The status bar code needs to work on Windows 7, and that status bar can't be customized. Also text like &quot;Disk free space&quot; is localized by the system so I can't simply add my own text.
