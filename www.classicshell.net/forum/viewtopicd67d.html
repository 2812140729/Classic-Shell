Personally this kind of thing irritates me greatly, because not being deemed &quot;safe&quot; by mother Microsoft isn't quite the same thing as being deemed &quot;unsafe&quot;, now is it?  They're just arbitrarily getting in the way of people's work, no doubt to push people away from downloading that awful wild non-App Store software.<br /> <br />Of course the answer is to ditch SmartScreen.  This came up on a test VM that I haven't done that with.<br /> <br />-Noel

There are subtleties of the language at play here, and Microsoft is stepping over the line.  Someone needs to sue them for restraint of trade.  How are you supposed to gain a good reputation if no one can download the new release in the first place?<br /> <br />What about the poor user who sees the product for the first time and gets told this by Microsoft when he tries to download it?  He may never try again, always remembering that this product is &quot;unsafe&quot;.<br /> <br />-Noel

In the past I've seen the SmartScreen pop up with a warning but there was always a way to disregard the warning and continue (without completely disabling the SmartScreen). If it doesn't let you continue, then may be it indeed considers the file to be unsafe.

As soon as the download completes, the file is deleted! I have Windows SmartScreen turned off (the one in Windows 8) but IE SmartScreen is on. I also have Windows Defender turned off and no other anti-virus installed. Other browsers letting me download it just fine.<br /> <br />VirusTotal.com also shows it clean. IE's OverSmartScreen is acting up again.

Either that or Microsoft decided to whitelist it and other offerings.

Perhaps they listen for screams, and thus get an idea of how painful it will be for them when they ultimately close the door permanently to 3rd party software.<br /><br />People whose 3rd party software is flagged - even briefly - ought to hire lawyers to threaten Microsoft, who will of course hear that &quot;scream&quot; and have to spend a little money to respond.
