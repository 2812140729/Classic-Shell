If it was real, I would want it a little more subtle.<br />Some animated effects look great at the start, like fireworks, then one tires of seeing effect after a number of times.<br />Other effects look nice and one does not tire of.<br /><br />Kind of like sounds. <br />At one job I had, production manager asked me to make a time bell for the break times,<br />throughout staggered 2 shifts. Each day went off 25 times.<br />Seems bad, but when you are concentrating on your work, one tends to forget to look what time it is. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Then miss the coffee truck. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br /><br />I tried many sounds. There was only one sound, (vibraphone chime with different pitches/tempo), <br />that could be played throughout the day, that was pleasant to listen to. <br />If I had used any other sound, people would have complained to shut it down the second day.<br />It lasted for over 5 years before company finally bought a professional all in one system.<br /><br />Remember when hundreds of transition effects came out for video/slide shows?<br />Most just get too distracting. People had more effects than the content. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Its better when effect randomly happens, or subtle.<br /><br />How about that for a comment. Next time gonna be just one word.
