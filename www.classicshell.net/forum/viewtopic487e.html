If you want it, I'd be happy to upload the files somewhere :7<br /><br />@Guarav This thread could actually be interpreted as a duplicate of a thread I made a while ago about Taskbar buttons, but nobody in their right mind would draw that association since one thread is about making things prettier, while the other is about making them easier to use, not to mention how the two requests could result in different feature implementations if anything was done on Classic Shell's end .-.

Reading this helped me to find out why themes didn't work for me: as a staunch supporter of the classic shell, I had Themes service disabled home domain-wide. Now they work. But there's a big trouble with all classic themes: they change the look of the most of Internet sites in my Firefox. Of this forum, too - its background becomes all white if I choose a classic theme. BTW your theme (&quot;Windows 8.1 [Dark Active Button]&quot;) doesn't actually changes anything for me - I mean in comparison to the default Windows theme with those &quot;Egypt pyramids&quot;. No dark button.<br /><br /><strong>Splitwirez</strong>, I'd like to try these buttons, so please download them somewhere.

And yes, I restarted Unsigned themes service.<br />Classic themes change the look of many applications including Firefox which is completely unacceptable:<br /><a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0201/3365d41d67b82fe67e5fec624964be07.png.html" class="postlink"><img src="../../i89.fastpic.ru/thumb/2017/0201/07/3365d41d67b82fe67e5fec624964be07.jpg" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0201/a120240a865613e935958dcb7e79f7cd.png.html" class="postlink"><img src="../../i89.fastpic.ru/thumb/2017/0201/cd/a120240a865613e935958dcb7e79f7cd.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />I believe this is by design 'cause all these themes are high contrast variations. Very bad.<br />Windows 8.1 [Dark Active Button] theme doesn't actually show dark active button for me:<br /><a href="http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0201/d9298402942a55a88f6c0d033cd35c76.png.html" class="postlink"><img src="../../i91.fastpic.ru/thumb/2017/0201/76/d9298402942a55a88f6c0d033cd35c76.jpg" alt="" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Splitwirez</strong>, I tried your theme but unfortunately it doesn't do what I need, too.<br /><br />I want a simple thing: solid color desktop, the visually different active task button on the taskbar and left-aligned window titles. Along with not touched look of other applications. Is it too much for Win8? Unbelievable.

Visually distinct Active Task button<br />Well that's been provided, but it looks like you've installed it incorrectly. You have to copy the &quot;aero7&quot; and &quot;aero8&quot; folders to &quot;C:\WINDOWS\Resources\Themes&quot;.<br /><br />3. Left-aligned Window titles<br />A custom Visual Style can do that for SOME, but not ALL applications. This feature is provided by a project which aims to resurrect the Classic theme. <a href="http://winclassic.boards.net/thread/38/classictheme-exe" class="postlink">More on that here</a> (though be warned, it's pretty broken right now...usable, but not fully functional).<br /><br />4. Untouched application appearance<br />That's entirely possible, it's the High-Contrast feature which was interfering with Firefox while the Classic Styles were active.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That's what I said. Applying the theme is tricky unless you are an experienced user. If you follow the exact steps and make no mistakes when copying files to the correct directories, it should work. The fresh screenshots attached here are proof that they work.<br /><br />Your screenshots show that for some reason the theme is not getting applied properly. It may either because you didn't follow the correct steps or maybe you copied the files incorrectly.<br /><br />I recommend you use only one theme patcher at a time. UxStyle IMO is better because it does in-memory patching and has been rock solid always. You should revert all changes made by UltraUXThemePatcher and do not use it/uninstall it. It may also be the case that UxStyle isn't working because the files are patched versions by UltraUXThemePatcher.<br /><br />Here is my DEFAULT Windows 8.1 theme but with darker button for active window. In the link I posted above, there is also a theme for Windows 8.1 with Windows 7 appearance/visual style and darker taskbar button for active window. Of course, it will require the Themes service to be running as well as the Unsigned Themes service. It is NOT a classic theme, it does not have any classic theme elements. These are regular Windows 7/8.1 themes with darker active taskbar button. Extremely rare. I got them via 'PainteR', a friend of a friend for no cost! He's a pro at theme design and hacking/patching and was extremely kind to have spent his time creating these themes for me. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> I am a complete n00b at theme making and never ventured into modifying themes unless it affected usability in a really bad way. I am familiar with Vista/Windows Style Builder and know what needs to be done but it's a lot of work modifying any theme properly.<br /><br />Also there is a theme in the same ZIP for Windows 7 with a darker button for active window.<br /><br />Windows 10 can go die in hell. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Windows 7 appearance<br /><br />There is only a Windows 7 theme for Windows 7 that I have with a darker active window and left aligned titles, as this screenshot shows.<br /><br />Also note that themes/visual styles are very OS specific. A theme for Windows 8.1 won't correctly apply to Windows 8 and vice versa. Even the subsequent updates that Windows 8.1 got (Update 1, Update 2 and Update 3) caused themes to break so you'll need a theme specific to the last FIXABLE version of Windows, which is 8.1 Update 3 (November 2014 Update Rollup) before you can correctly apply these themes.

These are regular Windows 7/8.1 themes with darker active taskbar button. Extremely rare. I got them via 'PainteR', a friend of a friend for no cost! He's a pro at theme design and hacking/patching and was extremely kind to have spent his time creating these themes for me. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> I am a complete n00b at theme making and never ventured into modifying themes unless it affected usability in a really bad way. I am familiar with Vista/Windows Style Builder and know what needs to be done but it's a lot of work modifying any theme properly.</div><br />...if I ever said I wouldn't take a request of the sort, it was because I'd have thought you wanted me to build an entire style for you, not because I would't have made a small change like this.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Guarav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Windows 10 can go die in hell. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div><br /><img src="http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/257423i450CA8BFA1A9D844/image-size/original?v=mpbl-1&amp;px=-1" alt="" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Unfortunately it turns off the DWM making the experience jerky and far from smooth.

That said, the flat colors do look ugly. Luckily, Windows 8.1 can be skinned and it will remain as you want! You can now skin the taskbar too thanks to Classic Shell besides window frames. Windows 10 on the other hand does backstabbing changes via updates. It's over really. Windows 10 is the Devil. I can't even begin to state what's wrong with it.<br /><br />Btw I don't get white titles with that theme on 8.1. Again something on your PC that's making it not apply the theme correctly. I get black titles. There is nothing different from the default 8.1 theme except the taskbar active window button appearance.<br /><br />This is why Windows 10 is bad: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic8e75.html?f=12&amp;t=7297#p31524">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=7297#p31524</a><!-- l --><br /><br />This is my 8.1 theme. Yes, the title bar's flat color is a little bit ugly but hey it's usable at least. It tells me which is the active window **easily**. And if you don't like it, you can skin it to make it like Windows 7!

There are two ways to fix this;<br />1. Use the SetWindowCompositionAttribute tool from the Aeroglass 8.1+ website to remove both effects (this can be automated via AHK or a BAT file)<br />2. Use a black or extremely dark wallpaper...atleast, the part of the wallpaper behind the taskbar has to be black. The rest can be whatever you want.

Could it be that you tried it, saw nothing immediately visible happen, and concluded it didn't work from that?
