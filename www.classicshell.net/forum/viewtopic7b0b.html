		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have Classic Shell 4.3.0 and I recently received the Windows 10 Creators update, but I lost the ability to use Classic Start Menu due to a recurring (looping?) type of explorer(?) crash and restart that never ends until I end the Classic Shell process in Task Manager. I've already sent my two cents worth to the Windows team telling them that their Win10 start menus are clunky and dinosaur-like and they should never have taken away our ability to choose to use the classic start menu. I don't expect them to do anything about it, but I like Classic Shell's Classic Start Menu better anyway and I'm LOST without it. I just need to find out which of my programs or files might be causing this problem. I have attached my log file. (I hope it worked...I don't see it anywhere.) By the way, the last thing I did before saving the log file was try to load the Classic Start Menu Settings, so any conflicting files or processes should show up right at the end of the log. Thanks!				 NOTE:  Please see addendum below. Also, I can't seem to figure out how to add a &quot;carriage return&quot; in my post without causing a text box to appear around my post and not allowing me to add any text thereafter.

I could have sworn I had read his/hers (and a good number of others) yesterday, but somehow it wasn't registering that the wording of the problem was the same thing I'm experiencing. I just checked my programs installed and lo and behold, I do have IDT Audio. I am poised to uninstall it, but I'm worried about what affect it might have on my sound and if it does mess something up, will I be able to find and reinstall it? I couldn't find any reference to IDT Audio in my Device Manager under Sound or Audio Inputs and Outputs. I don't know where else to look. Anyone have any reassurances for me before I go for it and uninstall IDT Audio??? Thanks, and thanks for you patience, as I am new to the forum but learning fast. :)

All I found on the Internet was advice to simply uninstall it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://tc-itservices.com/microsoft/idt-audio-panel-causes-control-panel-to-crash-in-windows-10/">http://tc-itservices.com/microsoft/idt- ... indows-10/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />BTW, this is not a crash just in the start menu. People are reporting the same crash with simply viewing the Control Panel in Explorer. The root of the problem is the file C:\Windows\system32\IDTNc64.cpl. You can try renaming it to _IDTNc64.cpl and see if that fixes the crash without fully uninstalling IDT.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />AN AUTOMATIC FIX CAME TO MY COMPUTER TODAY!  I have good news for everyone!!  I was dragging my feet about doing anything with the IDT Audio to fix this problem when the solution just fell into my lap.  I received a popup from HP (I have an HP laptop) that said there was an IDT HIGH-DEFINITION (HD) AUDIO DRIVER UPDATE to download and install (I hadn't even touched the driver or program yet, it was just an automatic update notification).  I went ahead and installed it on the chance that they might actually have made a change that would affect Classic Shell. After a REBOOT, I tried to open the Classic Shell Control Panel and my screen remained on. I clicked Start and the Classic Start Menu was already running and all was working fine!  The only difference was that my chosen custom Start button wasn't there, but that's a simple matter of re-selecting it. I hope this helps everyone!  If you haven't received the update yet, try checking on the Windows website or the website for your computer's manufacturer. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

This certificate business is a means to make money for the rich companies to sell you &quot;security&quot; whose value and usefulness are questionable considering the amount you have to pay. Regardless of the signed binaries, installers can still get replaced. 99.9% people don't even check for the digital signature or the different UAC prompt.<br /><br />A better way to build trust is to through reputation. Classic Shell has a solid reputation now. Just educate people to get it from the official website.<br /><br />Read The great digital certificate ripoff: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/02/27/the-great-digital-certificate-ripoff/">https://successfulsoftware.net/2008/02/ ... te-ripoff/</a><!-- m --> and you might agree.<br /><br />You can get a cheaper Code Signing certificate here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://codesigncert.com/">https://codesigncert.com/</a><!-- m --> (the Comodo one for 3 years is $177, so it comes to $59 per year), but it is still a ripoff. You shouldn't have to shell out money to build a &quot;trusted&quot; freeware app for Microsoft's platform. If anything, Microsoft should be paying for the certificates of apps with well-known reputation and exceptional value.

They were persistent on a reboot.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Windows 10 Start Menu no longer shows an &quot;All Apps&quot; option so it very difficult to find previously-used, non-Microsoft programs. However, it is possible to eventually hunt down desired programs, create shortcuts, and pin them to the Taskbar. These too are persistent, but associated right-click jump-lists are often missing, leaving only launch and unpin options.<br /><br />The Classic Shell Start Menu and expandable Program fly-out is a delight to use and does allow items to be pinned to the Taskbar but, as I previously stated, they do not persist beyond the current session.

The pinned items are mostly regular Win32 apps. After a reboot, some shortcuts are missing from the folder. It is very suspicious that I find it impossible for the Chrome or Firefox browsers to stay! <br /><br />I have previously followed your suggestion of deleting everything in the pinned folder, but it makes no difference. Interestingly, &quot;new apps&quot; pinned to the Taskbar seem to be stored elsewhere.

Nor can I reproduce the buggy behavior on my Windows 10 PC.

My Windows10 ver is 1607. <br />So far everyone is talking about problems and how to fix them. Personally, I would like to take a different approach, a preventive approach.<br />Let me explain.<br />I have managed to hold back the Creators Update so far, but sooner or later I will have to give in. <br />My question is what steps can I take on a PREEMPTIVE basis in case it screws up and/or destroys my Classic Shell? Meaning: can I save my Classic Shell settings somewhere nicely IN CASE I need to reinstall it? Would it make sense to first uninstall Classic Shell before the Windows Update and then to re-install it again?<br />Thanks for your ideas and comments.</div>Classic Shell Settings can be saved to an XML file using the Backup button in the Settings dialog which is present on every tab. Just preserve that XML and restore it in case anything goes wrong. It would also be a good idea to upgrade to Classic Shell 4.3.1 before moving to Windows 10 Creators Update.

Maybe it's an option I'm using, I don't know, I have <em>so</em> many customized settings and trying to troubleshoot them is an ordeal.  The most I can try is exporting my settings, resetting to default and seeing if it still happens.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Can anyone try the Windows Explorer setting &quot;Launch folder windows in a separate process&quot; (File Explorer Options)</div><br />I've been using this since Windows XP.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">ZeBe wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Only one thing helped (for me...): a new administrator account... </div><br />If this is the case, then it may never actually get fixed.<br /><br />Did you upgrade from a previous OS install?  I upgraded from 7.
