Thoughts?

Hopefully everything will work as before<br />4) Open the settings dialog, and save the settings to XML file<br />5) Change some minor setting and press OK<br />6) Upgrade to 4.0.4<br />7) If the settings reset again, import the XML file<br /><br />Let me know how it goes.

Thanks for the help!<br /><br />After I upgraded to 4.04 following your steps, all is fine- I didn't have to import the XML file.<br /><br />I wonder if you should split our discussion off into it's own separate thread so others that may have this problem can locate the solution.<br /><br />Again, thanks for helping getting my PC back to normal!!

You can safely upgrade from any version to use to version 4.0.4. All your settings will be preserved.<br /><br />If your Recent Documents folder is empty, the Windows setting for it might be turned off. Right click an empty area of the Taskbar -&gt; go to the Start Menu tab and check &quot;Store and display recently opened items in Jump Lists.&quot;.</div>GauravK:<br /><br />Please excuse my tardy reply. I have been swamped by other projects.<br /><br />Thanks for the information that I can install Classic Shell 4.0.4 without first uninstalling 4.0.2.<br /><br />Thanks also for the Jump Lists fix for my Recent Documents Folder. I had deliberately disabled Jump Lists, because I had never heard of them before getting a new 64-bit Win7sp1 laptop, and I have a habit of not installing stuff for which I don't see a need. I didn't realize that the Recent Documents Folder needed Jump Lists --- after all, it didn't need that in WindowsXP!<br /><br />Now a question: At the beginning of this thread, in your first post after IVO's opening post, you wrote:<br />&quot;Full Group Policy support for Classic Shell's settings. Group Policy Administrative Templates (ADMX files) for tweaking all Classic Shell settings are in C:\Program Files\Classic Shell\PolicyDefinitions.zip.&quot;<br />For a 32-bit computer, that statement makes unambiguous sense.<br /><br />As you know, a 64-bit computer has a C:\Program Files folder for 64-bit software, and a C:\Program Files (x86) folder for 32-bit software, and a 32-bit computer always has only a C:\Program Files folder.<br /><br />So I am <strong><em>guessing</em></strong> that PolicyDefinitions.zip <em><strong>always</strong></em> goes into a C:\Program Files folder, <em><strong>because</strong></em> Classic Shell always installs as 64-bit software on a 64-bit computer, and as 32-bit software on a 32-bit computer.<br /><br />Is my guess correct?<br /><br />R.N.
