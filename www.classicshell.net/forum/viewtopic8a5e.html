Get it just right at sweet viewing angle, move off right angle just a bit,<br />now the left column is green, and right is purple. I want my Dell 22 inch cathode ray tube monitor back!<br />Can't computer guys come together to have a higher color bit standard, <br />or at least a half decent 8 bit to 16 bit upload converter built into operating system?<br />Does not look very plexy anymore.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Might be better all solid colors.<br /><br />May have to pass on this pastel mod. No time. <br /><br />Someone else take a crack at it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello Splitwirez.<br /><br />About the wondering,<br />here is medium version answer. I won't give long version. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Yes, indeed. Good question, with a question.<br />Why even use a virtual machine, when the resources are right in the disk,<br />that can be readily accessed?<br />Skill and knowledge of what to look for and retrieving that data, into usable form, is what I don't have.<br />Powerful Google search finds pictures fast. May not be the greatest quality.<br />It is relatively easy to clone out text, as long as something close by is same texture.<br /><br />Not that I did not attempt different ways.<br />*Virtual machine failed to install, as it saw 0 V hard drive space. Possibly bios date wrong. Did not know about at the time.<br />*Used resource hacker and found some stuff in, <br />I think 386 file on disk. Still no knowledge of where to look for everything. <br />*Attempted three different versions of longhorn install on real computer. Problem is difficult with newer computer with USB3,<br />and only 1 old IBM mouse/keyboard input. Without a splitter, can only have one at a time. Out of three, got one to boot eventually, just had even worse looking buttons on the desktop and in Plex theme msstyles. As I don't know the way the system is telling the compressed button to draw itself, guess what? Searching screenshots for the different milestones, is still the best.<br /><br />Here is short answer: They never finished perfecting Ui, before moving to next one, and next one, etc.<br />                      So it's only to get an idea starting point. <br /><br /><br />I don't want to copy exactly. Had to be different, with the risk of turning ugly. The top bar instead of light to dark, is dark to light, taken from explorer page. Forget which version picture. The left pane color is exactly original (light variation),<br />but looks different from optical illusion, being close to different right pane. <br /><br />I'm really late now, bye.

It should be readable, <br />just not on the dark variation. I did not try it out. Just in my mind.<br />If it's too hard to read on dark jump, I cold lighten that side a bit.<br /><br />As usual, will work on it on weekend time.

I use the cascading All Programs menu so whether inside program background is white or not is not important to me. But you have an option for that already <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Yes you're right, the search results and jumplist text will have to be made black if the background is white.<br /><br />Actually, if you are too busy, I can attempt editing it but since you created this skin, I thought you would be faster at it. Don't feel any obligation, and take your time. I understand you do this in your spare time and am grateful for the lovely skins you come up with for free!

Almost always showing new update program buttons.<br /><br />With split buttons, does function work differently on touch screens?<br />On regular monitor, just hovering over, will open up anyway.<br />Only time I have to click on it to open, is when exiting an unsuccessful search.

The Start Menu setting also does other things:<br />- The scroll with the mouse by hovering over the pager buttons is disabled if touchscreen is detected so you can scroll with your finger. You can click or tap on the pager buttons to scroll.<br /><br />The changes I suggested to the skin when touch is enabled are only so it becomes easier to target the areas with the finger by making them larger. The split button's right portion is too small normally so if the user tries to tap on it to show the jumplist or submenu, he can accidentally tap on the left portion of the button. By increasing the padding, the target area becomes larger. It does not affect how they work because there is no reason to change their behavior.

Would have to find again on net or make thicker frames, and such.<br />The 64 pixel icon behind user picture will stay same size, <br />regardless of increasing DPI size. There would be a giant size miss<br />match with user picture.<br /><br />Does Ivo have some workaround option for legacy 96DPI skins, <br />where the menu as a whole be can be switched on 2x times the size?<br />Not as a stretch but a whole magnification of everything, <br />similar to Windows Magnifier tool that does for entire screen, <br />but in this case only the start menu is drawn bigger. <br /><br />Technology marches on. I have old school system. For people buying the latest and greatest, <br />there must be an awful lot of old programs not made for super Hidpi density. How do they work with smaller graphic elements.

I wrote an article at Winaero about it: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-fix-apps-that-look-small-on-high-dpi-and-high-resolution-displays/">http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-fix-apps ... -displays/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />But that trick will only work for apps which are not high DPI-ready but which falsely claim to be high DPI-ready. Classic Shell is actually high DPI ready for the most part.<br /><br />Oh well, I will update it some day to size 64 which is the max.allowed size.

I switched to Small icons+larger padding in 2nd column (since my small icon size is quite big). And edited the skin to increase the split arrow padding and Shutdown text+arrow paddings as I always do since you know the split button must actually be large enough to open with a finger without accidentally causing the left portion of the button to get triggered. Now it's perfect and future-ready. The skin matches my XP Embedded taskbar texture as if they were made for each other.<br /><br />The only limitation is that the icon at the top of the 2nd column - when it changes from the user picture to some other icon as we hover over 2nd column items - it is still small. Hopefully, Ivo will address that in the future revision of Classic Shell. Seeing large beautiful icons in the Start menu will be such a delight.<br /><br />I make scrollbars quite thick too because that's how big they were in Windows 95/original Classic Windows. That was before the obsession to make super slim, hiding, floating, invisible, impossible-to-click scrollbars began.<br /><br />My DPI is 150%. Tip: Always use the pre-set DPI scaling intervals that MS provides: 100%, 125%, 150%, 200% because if you use a custom value, the desktop icons are scaled poorly and look hideously ugly.<br /><br />juniper7, if I meet you in real life, I'm gonna buy you a beer. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
