I hate asking dumb questions, but I hate it MORE to not be able to have Classic Shell &#40;I am hooked!&#41; So here goes:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;Windows 8 &#40;as mentioned above&#41;, and IE9; <span style="text-decoration: underline">had</span> been using CS 3.98.&#41;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">A few days ago, CS stopped its usual display in IE9, and threw me back to the Metro -- I mean, Modern -- look &#40;which I find to be completely unusable.&#41; The standard Tech Support question is, &quot;did you install any software or make any changes to your system?&quot; I <span style="text-decoration: underline">had</span> recently installed some software &#40;stuff to attempt to manage my Dell monitor&#41;, but that was a couple days previously. It&#39;s <span style="text-decoration: underline">possible</span> that one of the Dell programs might have done an update just before I noticed this problem; but I can&#39;t fully remember.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;1&#41; The first thing I did was to try a System Restore back to a couple day before installing the Dell software. I&#39;m not sure whether that was a good idea; but it didn&#39;t fix the problem. I didn&#39;t check any of the settings in IE before doing this; and I probably &quot;shoulda&quot; done that, too.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;2&#41; I then came to the ClassicShell site, to look for other fixes. I was hoping to find a way to just &quot;refresh&quot; the CS installation. However, I noticed that version 4.0 had been released. I figured that installing that would probably take care of any &quot;refreshing&quot; that needed to be done. It didn&#39;t.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;3&#41; I then <span style="text-decoration: underline">completely</span> uninstalled CS, and rebooted. I then ran the CS 4.0 install again. No help.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;4&#41; I went through the steps in the ReadMe &#40;yes, people DO read those things!&#41;:</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;a&#41;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">&quot;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">The toolbar for Windows Explorer may not show up automatically after installation. You have to do a few things before you can use it.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;"></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><strong><span style="color:#0070c0;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Windows 8:</span></span></strong><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Press Alt+V to open the View ribbon. Click on the down arrow in the “Options” section. Select “Classic Explorer Bar” &quot;</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;">For me, pressing Alt+V did not open the View ribbon. Instead, it opened the drop-down menu attached below.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><img src="file_/C_/Users/GBE63C_1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtml1/01/clip_image002.html" alt="" /></span></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">I selected &quot;Toolbars&quot;, since that seemed to be the closest thing. The entry for the &quot;Classic Shell Bar&quot; did appear, but was unchecked. I clicked it to &quot;tick&quot; it; but nothing changed on the screen. I opened the menu again, and CS was <span style="text-decoration: underline">still</span> unchecked! Tried this several times; but something would not let me &quot;tick&quot; the Bar. I figured this was probably a problem!</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;b&#41; &quot;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">If these steps don’t work, it may be possible that the Explorer extensions have been disabled. Check the following, then try to show the toolbar again:</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">1&#41;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">Open Internet Explorer and go to Tools -&gt; Manage add-ons. Locate the add-ons “Classic Explorer Bar” and “ExplorerBHO Class” and make sure they are enabled.&quot;</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">They both were. In addition, &quot;ClassicIEBHO Class&quot; and &quot;Classic IE Settings&quot; appeared, and were enabled.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;c&#41; &quot;</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">2&#41; Maybe the browser extensions are disabled on your system. This is usually the default for Windows Server. Open the &quot;Internet Options&quot;, go to the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, and check the option &quot;Enable third-party browser extensions&quot;.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">This was already checked.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">&#40;d&#41; {Editorial comment}</span><span style="font-family:Calibri;">&quot;On Windows 8 the Classic Explorer status bar is different from the one in Explorer. You can show/hide the first one from the Classic Explorer settings dialog and show/hide the second one from Explorer’s folder options dialog.&quot;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">This sentence made absolutely no sense to me; yet I think it&#39;s talking about something important. Please take a shot at rewording and/or expanding this. I don&#39;t know if you can get away with just saying &quot;Explorer&quot;; there are both &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; and &quot;File Explorer&quot; &#40;thankfully renamed from &quot;Windows Explorer&quot;!&#41; It seems that what you are talking about here <span style="text-decoration: underline">could</span> be related to either one. Also, I think a little more expansion on which menus are involved &#40;and how to get to them&#41; would be helpful. You did a great job on this in the other two sections I quoted above.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">================================================</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">So I&#39;m stuck. I&#39;m sure there is a problem with the menu I mentioned above, and the fact that it would not allow CS to remain ticked. But I don&#39;t know what to do next.</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">I will comment here that part of the blame may lie with Windows 8. Amongst the many other ways I despise it, I am really unhappy about all the new restrictions it places on who can write what to where. The restrictions are not logical; and I believe they have messed with other things I have tried to install. These restrictions won&#39;t let <span style="text-decoration: underline">me</span> see &#40;or edit&#41; many sections of the Registry; and I have a real issue with that! I believe that all this &quot;locking&quot; behavior may be interfering with CS&#39;s ability to go in and make changes &#40;although I <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> have CS installed since sometime in August, and it had been working great!&#41;</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Thanks,</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Cheebie</span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"></span>

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />If all addons are enabled in the Manage Addons dialog, and yet you are unable to enable the File Explorer toolbar, then it may be a case of File Explorer getting confused with the toolbars it has installed. To fix that, first close all File Explorer windows. Then open Registry Editor (C:\Windows\system32\regedit.exe) and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Toolbar\ShellBrowser key and delete the value called ITBar7Layout. Then re-open File Explorer and try ticking CS again.<br /><br /><br />About the status bar wording, what it means is that on Windows 8, an independent status bar is added by Classic Shell, unlike on Windows 7 where it merely modifies the File Explorer status bar. Enable it from the Status Bar tab in Classic Explorer settings (Start Menu -&gt; All programs -&gt; Classic Shell -&gt; Classic Explorer settings). But Windows 8 File Explorer also has its own dysfunctional status bar that does not show all the relevant information. Having two status bars is redundant. So you may want to disable the built-in Windows 8 File Explorer status bar. To do that, go to File Explorer's Folder Options. Folder Options is in the Control Panel or you can also access it from the View tab of the File Explorer Ribbon.<br /><br /> <br /> Your screenshot shows that you are opening the View menu of Internet Explorer. In Internet Explorer, Classic Shell does not add a toolbar. It restores the page title to the title bar of IE and puts back the page loading progress indicator, and other information to IE's status bar. To turn on IE's status bar, press Alt+Space in IE's main window, and check the &quot;Status bar&quot;.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;">Thanks for all the help, guys! I should've checked the site earlier!<br /><br />I'm really not a TOTAL dummie at this stuff; but Win8 has made me <span style="text-decoration: underline">feel</span> like one (maybe I should buy the book....)<br /><br />Let me clarify something: the problems I am experiencing are with INTERNET Explorer (not FILE Explorer, as far as I know. I have attached a screen shot of what the File Explorer window looks like.) I also just realized that the problem I'm experiencing may have to do with a THEME that I installed around the same time as CS; I'm just not sure who's doing what. (Aside to Gaurav: belated thanks for the Theme you posted for me. I later found <span style="text-decoration: underline">this</span> one: </span><a href="http://xxinightxx.deviantart.com/art/Windows-Classic-Vs-372853688" class="postlink"><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;">http://xxinightxx.deviantart.com/art/Windows-Classic-Vs-372853688</span></a><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;"> which <span style="text-decoration: underline">really</span> did a great job of completing the restoration back to a Windows Classic look (line widths, colors, etc.)<br /><br />I have also attached a screen shot of what IE looks like when I open it (and please let me know if you would prefer a different graphics format, etc.) Problems:<br />(1) There is no &quot;tab bar&quot; or other toolbars at the top. Previously, these bars ALWAYS appeared, and were in a format similar to what I used to see in Win XP (using the &quot;Classic&quot; Theme for XP, not the &quot;XP&quot; Theme, if you know what I mean.) If I push my mouse cursor up to the top of the screen, a toolbar of sorts appears; but it seems to come and go of its own accord. And when it <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> there, it covers up part of the web page (often, the important navigating features are at the very top!) This toolbar does NOT look like the one I had before. With regard to the &quot;covering up&quot;, I think there may be some issues here with <span style="text-decoration: underline">parts</span> of Classic Shell still loading and working.<br /><br />(2) The Task Bar at the bottom goes away when I go into IE. Previously, this would stay in place when I opened an IE window. In response to Jcee, I <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> have the Classic Shell Start button, <span style="text-decoration: underline">when</span> I have the Taskbar!! But no Taskbar in IE, etc.<br /><br />For these reasons, I believe (in response to Ivo) that I <span style="text-decoration: underline">have</span> been kicked back to a Metro look.<br /><br />Some specific replies:<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Jcee</span></strong>: <br />I have not yet tried going directly to &quot;ClassicExplorerSettings.exe&quot;, because I wanted to get these clarifications posted first. Again, there is some confusion for me with regard to &quot;Explorer&quot; settings as opposed to &quot;Internet Explorer&quot; settings.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Gaurav</span></strong>: <br />- With regard to your comments about File Explorer and RegEdit: see above with respect to FE vs. IE. Therefore, I did not try the RegEdit change you suggested. I am perfectly willing to attempt any RegEdit changes you suggest; but recall that my access to modifying the Registry seems to be very limited (even though I am set up as an Administrator.) [Off-topic: if anyone knows of a way to loosen Win8's grip on all these read/write privileges, and restore them to something more like XP had, I would <span style="text-decoration: underline">greatly</span> appreciate a referral! The current Win8 setup feels more like airport security after 9-11!!]<br /><br />- Thank you for expanding on the wording about the Status Bar. Again, it appears that this is related to FILE Explorer, not INTERNET Explorer. <br /><br />- You said: <strong>&quot;In Internet Explorer, Classic Shell does not add a toolbar. It restores the page title to the title bar of IE and puts back the page loading progress indicator, and other information to IE's status bar.&quot;</strong> Considering the information I have provided above, does that mean that Classic Shell was <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> the entity which was providing the look that I liked? Do I need to be working with the Theme instead?<br /><br />- You said: <strong>&quot;To turn on IE's status bar, press Alt+Space in IE's main window, and check the &quot;Status bar&quot;.&quot;</strong> I did try that, and got a menu of &quot;toolbars&quot; that seemed appropriate (again, I apologize if I am not quite calling things by their correct names.) The Status Bar <span style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> checked. However, an entry for &quot;Classic Explorer Bar&quot; <span style="text-decoration: underline">also</span> appears, and it is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> checked. When I click on that entry, it does not get &quot;ticked&quot;, and it seems like that might be part of my problem. Then again, given what you said above about &quot;Classic Shell does not add a toolbar...&quot; - I don't know what to think.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Ivo</span></strong>: <br />Thank you for checking in! As you can see from the above, _I_ may not understand what the problem is <span style="text-decoration: underline">either</span>!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><br />Thanks to all; I hope this additional info clarifies things a bit.<br />Cheebie</span>

I still have one question, though: I still have the problem where I can't &quot;tick&quot; the Classic Explorer Bar in IE. Maybe it's not necessary. However, its behavior has changed a little bit: when I open that menu (Alt+Space) and try to &quot;tick&quot; that toolbar, Windows asks me if I want to &quot;disable this add-on?&quot;, and then lists &quot;ExplorerBHO Class&quot; and &quot;ClassicIEBHO Class&quot;. It did this once or twice to me before (out of many attempts); but now it asks about the disabling <span style="text-decoration: underline">every</span> time.<br /><br />Is this an issue? Am I losing anything by not having that Toolbar available? Any ideas on how to fix the situation?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Cheebie</span>
