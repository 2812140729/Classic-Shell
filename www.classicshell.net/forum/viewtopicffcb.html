The caption buttons didn't look quite right to me, but I thought they were hilarious for some reason, and so I ported them to BorderSkin. Then, I decided to create a Start Menu skin and Button to match. Not sure whether that was anything more than an excuse to share the BorderSkin theme here, but nonetheless there's a Start Menu skin too. Behold, the stupidity:<br /><img src="../../www.mediafire.com/convkey/56cc/BloatedAeroCompletePreviewf24e.png?size_id=8" alt="" /><br />AND NOW...let there be download link! (and then there was a download link: <a href="../../www.mediafire.com/file/725kkoapirjagsd/BloatedAero.html" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/download/725kkoapirjagsd/BloatedAero.zip</a>)<br /><br />EDIT: BorderSkin is not associated with Classic Shell in any way at all, whatsoever, and no-one on this board is responsible for any problems you may have with it. In fact, I have a feeling I probably shouldn't even have mentioned it at all...meh, too late now .-.<br /><br />EDIT 2: Woops, wrong download link <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />
