The desktop works just fine but on the ASUS I cannot skip the Metro screen.  At boot, the Metro shows up for a long, long time before Classic Shell shows up.  Yes, I have the 'skip Metro' item checked <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  On the desktop Classic Shell shows up without showing any trace of Metro.  I have compared the settings on both machines one by one and they are identical as far as I can see.<br /><br />Will appreciate any help getting this sorted out.<br /><br />Thank you very much.

Windows 8 delays all programs by startup by several seconds and then slowly loads them unlike Windows 7 which is why the service had to be created.<br /><br />Open registry editor, go to HKLM\SOFTWARE\IvoSoft\ClassicShell and create a DWORD value named &quot;LogService&quot; and change it value to 1. Now restart the PC where it does not skip the Start screen. A log file called service.log will be generated in C:\Program Files\Classic Shell. Upload the log file attached to a post or send it to Ivo.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This might be a useful clue as to why Classic Shell doesn't skip Metro on some machines: It just started happening to me after I had to add .NET Framework 3.5 as a prerequisite to installing My Movies. So maybe something to do with Framework 3.5/3.0/2.0 causes the Classic Shell service to delay getting started. Additionally, the Desktop tile in Metro did show the desktop background before I added Framework 3.5, and now it initially shows the default blue screen with flower in that tile.<br />Is there a control that would get the Classic Shell service a higher start priority?<br /><br />(Otherwise, Classic Shell meets all my needs for feeling Windows 7 comfort in using Windows 8.)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />When the service starts it launches one copy of the start menu for every logged in user, and then starts listening for more login events. As soon as somebody logs in, a new copy of the start menu will be launched.<br /><br />The start menu (ClassicStartMenu.exe) tries to simulate pressing the Win+D key every half second. It stops when the desktop shows up or after 5 seconds.<br /><br />So basically if the desktop shows up but late, it means that the service was started late. If the desktop doesn't show up but you still get a start button, it means the Win+D didn't work (maybe something was blocking it).<br /><br />Basically the OS doesn't know that the service needs to be started during login. It starts whenever is its turn (which may be in the order of installation). One way to associate the start menu with the login is by using the scheduler. That's why I urge people having the first kind of problem (menu starts with some delay), to try the scheduler and report the results.

It is the last and only problem on a quite complex W8pro machine.<br /><br />Thanks to Acronis, I can always go back to the &quot;good&quot; mode.<br /><br />One day I will solve the problem. Sorry for being a perfectionist. However, many thanks to Ivo for developing this software. Without this, i would have had to downgrade the new PC to W7.

Since I collected all the Acronis image-files, I found out, that I moved to 3.6.4 at image-file number 16, dec 28, 2012. At this time, the machine was 90% finished and CS still worked fine. That destroys the theory, that the late installation of a new version results in a late start.<br /><br />What a nice problem.

The system (or some other program) overwrites the value to 3 and at a second start again the Classic Shell will load slow (30 sec on my system). In fact the instaler of Classic shell will set the value to 2, but the first start after the instalation the system will overwrite the value to 3.<br /> <br />The solution is:<br />1) Manually change the value  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\ClassicShellService---&gt; Start=2.<br />2) Prevent any changes to the registry key (lock it).
