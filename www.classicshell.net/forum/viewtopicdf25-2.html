A great job of providing something that keeps on working through whatever Microsoft throws at it. Thanks.

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I can't thank you enough for what you've done for us with Classic Shell and Classic Start Menu. When Windows came out with 8/8.1 and their awful idea to replace the Start Menu with a child-like bunch of disorganized, oversized color blocks known as buttons, I was pretty much in shock. I thought, &quot;Excuse me, Microsoft, but our computers are NOT just oversized phones!&quot; Nothing made any sense and it was taking me an inordinate amount of time trying to locate anything I used with any amount of frequency. I wanted my Start Menu back, darn it, and I would have paid to get it back! <br /><br />Enter Classic Shell and the wonderful, hard-working people who programmed this gem. With my disability and its effects, you can't imagine just how much Classic Start Menu has improved my quality of computing. I am sooo grateful for all of you and I hope it will be a good long time before you lose interest. For me, Classic Shell is one of only a handful of programs I have used throughout my LIFE time that I'd happily pay yearly for. After reading the very first post in this thread, I realized we could give donations and I am so happy to count myself among the giving! Thank you ALL for a really great program. You have made a whole lot of people a whole lot happier on their computers! <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> xo

Windows 10's UI was clearly designed for phones and tablets with the big blocky start screen, and were they on drugs designing the new start menu - its area to pin stuff to is blocky (which makes it only good for tablets/smartphones) but the all apps has a normal menu (which makes it only good for PC) <br />Classic Shell brings back the familiar Windows 7 start menu. Eventually, you forget about it because the start menu it adds is so familiar. It gives a decent ver- wait, I don't need to describe it! It's the Information Age, I can just link pictures: <a href="../../betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/classic-shell-Start.jpg" class="postlink">click me</a>! And if you don't like the style of that, you can <a href="../../betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/classic-shell-menu.jpg" class="postlink">change the style</a>!

And last, but not least, <a href="../images/gallery/custom_ie9.png" class="postlink">Classic IE options</a>! (which many of us will never need because IE is inherently rubbish)<br />Also, all features are optional and can be turned on or off at will.<br /><br />Onto some ratings. <br />Ease of use: 200%<br />Familiarity: 9001%<br />Customizability: 100.1%<br />Should-Come-With-Windows-10-ness: 110%<br />Overall: (awesomeness scale maxes out and explodes)<br />Pricing: Free<br />Value for money: N/A

Our lab computers in our University have never looked so slick. And the fact that using Group Policy is even an option(!!!!!). Incredible.<br /><br />Most importantly, however, all shortcuts in <strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</strong> are showing up. I can NOT believe that the idiots at Microsh*t have still not configured their start menus to display all program shortcuts in their start menu. (At least on 10 LTSB 2016). After working with Windows 10 regularly for a couple years now, I can say that Microsoft's Windows 10 start menu is fragile and buggy as heck. What an effing joke.<br /><br />This saved my hiney, looks natural and slick, and I'm looking forward to the compliments on the choice to use it from my boss &amp; co-workers.

The more I use it the faster it gets as I can customise it to show exactly what I want it to. It's even got me navigating the menu with just the keyboard which I never would have thought of even back in the Windows 95 days. Lightweight, fast, customisable and slickly integrated, what more do you need? Donated with thanks.

I was forced to upgrade from Windows 7 to 10 due to Win7 not directly supporting the new Ryzen processor I now use.  I didn't really like the new Win10 tile interface and was ecstatic to find Classic Shell and the fact to worked so well.  With add-on themes from the forum (Full Glass Vistalike RevB), I was able to change the start button and menus easily.  Looks great!  Having a link at the top to go back to the original Win10 interface (the &quot;Start Menu (Windows)&quot; link is a great just-in-case measure.  This is an awesome utility.  I'll be donating right after this post.
