Don't delete anything, just hide it. You can do a few tricks in Explorer to clean up the navigation pane:<br /><br />1. From Tools menu -&gt; Folder Options: General tab You can uncheck the option &quot;Show all folders&quot; so a lot of unnecessary folders get hidden.<br />2. In Folder Options: View tab: Check the option: Hide empty drives in the Computer folder.<br />3. Right-click the individual libraries (Documents, Pictures etc) and choose &quot;Don't show in navigation pane&quot; so only the parent &quot;Libraries&quot; item gets shown.<br />4. To completely hide special items like Libraries, Homegroup, Network, if you don't need them in the navigation pane, you can use a tool like Windows 7 Navigation Pane Customizer: <a href="http://www.door2windows.com/windows-7-navigation-pane-customizer-show-hide-rename-items-in-windows-explorer-navigation-pane/" class="postlink">http://www.door2windows.com/windows-7-navigation-pane-customizer-show-hide-rename-items-in-windows-explorer-navigation-pane/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Thu Apr 11, 2013 12:06 am</p><hr />

Every time we open Explorer (classic or the original Win 7), whether it be from C: drive or another drive what you end up on the left column is Libraries being opened and showing its sub folders (Documents, Music, etc.) and also the folder of your computer (which has a name you gave it when you installed windows). Below it are sub-folders, 'AppData, Application Data, Contacts, Cookies, etc.).<br />This showing of sub-folders bothers me in a few ways -1- the list is endless -2- some of the folders you can't even access (&quot;Location is not available&quot; message pops up) -3- I never use most of those sub-folders and most importantly of all -4- what I want is below this long list of sub-folders which forces me to scroll down.<br />My questions are these -1- How can I stop explorer opening itself with all of these sub-folders showing (just show its main folder and not its subs) -2- Can I safely 100% delete some of these folders since I never but never use them for ex, my Libraries.<br />The main reason why I downloaded and installed Classic Shell is because these 2 things bothered me so how can I change this? thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=532">pintree3</a> — Wed Apr 10, 2013 5:27 pm</p><hr />
