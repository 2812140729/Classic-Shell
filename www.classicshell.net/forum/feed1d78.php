Or you could downgrade those PCs to Windows 8.1 and see how much better it is and how well it runs with Classic Shell compared to Windows 10.<br /><br />Another option is an Android phone but not a very good one if it's not always on and always running the app. But I sometimes set the SAMBA server Android app as the Master browser: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funkyfresh.samba&amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... amba&amp;hl=en</a><!-- m --> Again the chances are that it won't work with those releases of Windows 10. I had major issues with Windows 10 SMB file sharing so I decided to never touch that OS again (besides many, many other headaches).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Fri Oct 27, 2017 7:04 am</p><hr />

The new master browser is not working properly in the new Windows 10 vs. 1703 and 1709 between windows to non windows devices. Before anyone says it is a SMB1 one thing or a registry issue or a firewall issue, I've created a list of the 20 things that are NOT the source of the issue and that this is specifically a windows to NON windows device problem. It works with every single previous version of windows - just not the 2 newest ones and apparently MS is aware of the issue but doesn't really think it is important since windows to Windows still works. Here is the article in case you want to read all of the things it is not before you post what you think it might be as this is a CONFIRMED issue with the new master browser, not related to SMB1, firewall, registry change, network card change, drivers, enabling disabling things. <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/e105ef02-962e-437f-aaf3-ad3b533571fb/master-browser-not-working-for-non-windows-devices-in-build-1709-and-1703?forum=win10itpronetworking" class="postlink">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/e105ef02-962e-437f-aaf3-ad3b533571fb/master-browser-not-working-for-non-windows-devices-in-build-1709-and-1703?forum=win10itpronetworking</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I do not want to run a second PC, a hyper V machine within my windows computer or buy a special netgear switch that can be the master browser. I'm hoping someone might know of a software master browser application I could get.
