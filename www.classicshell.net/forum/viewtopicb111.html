Otherwise the permissions or ownership on that folder can be messed up. Open Properties of Temp folder and take ownership and grant write permissions to the correct users and groups and then try running the installer again.<br /><br />Another possibility is that installer did not download completely. Try downloading it again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Weird. That folder should exist and be accessible by all users. It is also known as %ALLUSERSPROFILE%.<br />You can use the &quot;extract64&quot; parameter for the installer, which will manually extract the MSI file into the current directory: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/faq/#install_commands">http://www.classicshell.net/faq/#install_commands</a><!-- m --><br />Then you can just double-click the MSI file.<br /><br />But I recommend you figure out why your folder is missing. Other things will be broken in such case. Many programs store their information there.

It would not extract the MSI file from the download nor a copy I took from another computer where the installation had been successful.<br /><br />Whether this is a solution for others, I did work for me. On this computer there were two user accounts setup. Both had Administrator equivalents. Classic Shell would not install from one user, but switching to the other user account (it appears that was the first account setup on this laptop), it did install without any issues.<br /><br />I was able to configure Classic Shell for this user. I then logged into the other account and was able to configure that one without any issue as well.
