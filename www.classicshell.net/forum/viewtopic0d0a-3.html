Otherwise, I am clueless why the Start button is not added. Classic Explorer is a toolbar and adds some other features, but it should also be automatically enabled.

The computer came with Norton anti-virus, and I'm not sure how to check the settings to exclude the start menu as you suggested.  Perhaps you can enlighten me.   <br />  <br />   I had previously installed Win8 start button before I discovered Classic Shell, and I wonder if that is interfering.  I expected it would be eliminated during Classic Shell download, but perhaps not ??    <br />  <br />																   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cascabel

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Well, I finally found out what I needed to know on another website.   The original problem was how to access the controls to turn on various features, which I thought were missing.  Apparently the Win8 StartButton is part of Classic Shell, which should have been explained, which is why I couldn't figure out how to uninstall it separately !!<br /><br />   Nothing was wrong with the download and installation at all!!   I just didn't know that I needed to right click on the start button to access the settings.  I think that information should have been more prominently displayed for new users.   Explaining about the features without telling how to access the settings makes for great frustration.  Some of this stuff is not at all intuitive for us non-techie folks........

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The Start button is automatically added on Windows 8, the settings are automatically opened the first time the Start button is clicked where you can choose your style. From that same window, you can enable &quot;All Settings&quot; and you get access to all settings. Also, Classic Shell creates shortcuts to the settings inside &quot;All Programs&quot;. If the menu is not running, the settings related shortcuts show on the Start screen as well on Windows 8. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Plus, you can right click the Start button to access settings. So there are many ways to access settings. Maybe because you installed Win8 Start button first before Classic Shell, something went wrong and you didn't get the settings window and the Start button the first time it was installed. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
