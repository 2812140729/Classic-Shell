I followed the skinning tutorial, and put it into the .skin, but it doesn't work.<br />No icons in second column is supposed to be unchecked when you first load this skin, but it is checked when you first load the .skin file.<br />User picture also does this too.<br /><br />Happy Holidays &amp; a Happy New Year everyone! =)

The options are now unchecked when you reset the skin, however, they don't work now. <br /><br />Is it possible to add transparency on this skin without adding bitmaps? To still have color_custom but with a transparency level option?<br /><br />The system matching magnifier was actually R.O.B.'s idea. I also like this idea. I read that there were troubles with the magnifying search icon on high dpi for the xp skin. That xp skin is pretty nice though.<br /><br />Thanks for your help. I've uploaded a new .skin file to this post.

You could add extra real bitmap pixels on the right side of caption bitmap.<br /><br />Looking at what the wizard R.O.B has done. The bitmap is 21 pixels wide, with slicing X=21,1,1,0,1,0<br />That means if you make a bigger bitmap 24 pixels wide, those extra three pixels can be made around 190/255 alpha and black rgb.<br />You would also need to make a mask to have the color on the 3pixel sliver running along side of caption picture.<br /><br />It does start to get complicated. Opacity text needs to be added. Selectors have to be real 32 bit bitmaps, <br />or they will show right through menu to desktop behind. It would be a good idea to look at other skins to see what they did, <br />and copy over the bitmaps and text.<br /><br />I didn't notice there were xp magnifiers in the skin. Hmm..Ok, I went for the lighter bigger ones, R.O.B went for the darker edge ones.<br /><br />All this talk has got me interested again in Win 10 fake menus. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />I'm going to try out myself. I know can't have live, can't move them, can't this, can't that, but hey'<br />we each come up with different looks and ways. I have to try icon frames as buttons, making them bigger.<br />Forgot about the text, shoot. Ok, I'll try icons frames with emblem text. Oh boy, this is going to be complicated.<br />Give one or two weeks to explore all possibilities

Maybe that or other text is screwing things up?<br /><br />Also that &quot; [ &quot; is missing at start of the below line. It will not interpret correctly.

User picture adds a space for the user picture, but no actual user picture. I think rev2 the options are not checked, but dont work. I've attached the .skin.<br /><br />I tried adding the missing [ bracket only to the start menu .skin, but options remain checked on.<br /><br />This bug of having options checked on is present in R.O.B.'s original classic captions .skin. <br /><br /><br />I think that there was windows xp magnifiers for the search in this .skin, but I meant your high DPI xp skin that you made. It's pretty nice too.<br /><br /><br />I do like fake windows 10 start menus. I hope you good luck making one, if you do. <br /><br />Thanks for your help so far, its much appreciated =)

I had &lt;SkinC2 value=&quot;Classic-Skin-10rev7&quot;/&gt; instead of just 'classic-skin-10'.<br /><br />Here's a picture of the start menu with the user picture, and username set up. It seems to display correctly. Only the 'no-icons' in the second column the user picture &amp; username is overlayed  on top of the emblems, which isn't good.<br /><br /><img src="../../i63.tinypic.com/wlt2xh.png" alt="" /><br /><br />Slow but steady for the windows 10 menu you're working on then. <br />Cheers! =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So emblems are pictures that can't have a mask, or stretch. <br />The tint feature, the tiles changing color and having them integrated into the start menu sounds cool. <br />I'm not sure why Microsoft decided to have different metro colors for windows 8, and windows 10. If your skin can work on windows 7 too that'd be awesome. <br /><br />I meant the options for the tiles, like 80%, 40% , and no tiles. I didn't mean links, but I'm also not sure how to do them.<br /><br />Sounds good so far, the picture helps see what you want to do with it.<br /><br />Update, I made the start menu work with small icons, and with no icons. Though I'm not sure why the emblems don't move for two columns [small icons and noicons]<br />I have the new start menu attached with a XML file too.

I'm not sure how to make classic shell add more emblems if there is more space.

It looks like it is pushed up to the top with many recent programs, leaving a big space between 'run' and 'logoff'. <br /><br />Lol at the commandments. I had forgotten about that. xD

Guess there is something different. <br />The User_frame_position is missing the &quot;-&quot;, so it puts the picture on left side.<br />Yes that could work too. <br />Would have to increase top padding on left column of Classic 2 style, and bring the name over too. <br />Unless it was a mistake?<br /><br />I made a big booboo on my skin. A couple days ago, I started to play around with your skin.<br />I was tired, day dreaming, on autopilot mode. When I saved mod of your skin, I wasn't looking where it saved it.<br />It overwrote my skin, coz program remembered the path from before. I was so lucky. I had made a backup an hour before.<br />It's very dangerous switching back and forth between different modded skins. <br /><br />Back to your skin. If you still want the user picture on right, with extended emblems,<br />anything larger than menu will be cut off like Win 10 real menu.<br />You could always add an emblem mask for the emblems so emblems get cut a small distance before taskbar, like a border.<br />This emblem mask can control where the emblems show, or not show. <br />I'm not talking about an emblem mask on top of the emblem to control color on the emblem, because there is no such thing.<br /><br />Speaking of emblems, if you go that way with emblems as tall as monitor height, and don't mind the look of them cut off,<br />why not just use one giant emblem?<br /><br />Moving the &quot; COLUMN PADDING &quot; in the Customize tab, can push the space around the entries.<br /><br />Everyone uses different amounts of jumplists, and recent programs. For me 5 or less is good enough.<br />Could always preset amounts for xml file.<br /><br />As for my skin, I kind of lost interest. Got bogged down by the enormousity of it.<br />I don't think that's a word, but for sure, my skin is becoming enormously complex.<br />When I went on Win8.1, it's crazy. My skin has metro colors. On Win8.1 the desktop uses aero glass colors, not metro. <br />Metro colors work from the start screen, and there are no accent metro colors, because Win 10 invented after.<br />So to get a metro color, have to switch to start screen, adjust color, switch back to desktop. <br />As far as I know, auto color desktop picture, does not work on the metro colors, <br />so I think I will have to make a simple glass color option just for Win 8.1.<br />Too much, that's why I'm taking it easy, doing other activities.<br /><br />If I ever finish mine, maybe you could help me towards the end?<br />A number of the links I have as buttons, were made from shortcuts that I made and stored in my computer.<br />If I upload skin for other people, the links are not going to work.<br /><br />I'm not computer savvy, but I think you might be, because you were on the forum from years ago.<br />Commands and executable strings mean nothing to me, Ivo has put lots of commands, and links in the Customze section.<br />I can't find all the ones I want to directly work, that apply the icon as well. <br />I checked Winaero, Rainmeter site, other forums, for direct commands/links, can't seem to figure it out.<br /><br />Would you happen to know direct links for all these? <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> : <br /><br /><strike>Internet Explorer</strike><br /><br /><strike>Default programs</strike><br /><br /><strike>Devices and Printers</strike><br /><br /><strike>Programs and Features</strike> found it <br /><br /><strike>Disk Cleanup</strike> Thanks <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><strike>Defender</strike>

Ok, I'll try that. <br /><br />Yes, its lucky to have a backup. I did that before I think too. I also had made a backup. <br /><br />What do you mean by it will be cutoff like the real windows 10 menu? I'm not sure what you mean. <br /><br />An emblem mask? I'm not sure how to use it. x3 <br /><br />One giant emblem could work, but I guess I'm lazy lol , and the current emblems seem to work.<br /><br />Yes, I could preset the amount of recent programs. <br /><br />Idk, I think that's a word x3. It sounds like a lot of work. <br />Ah, so that's why metro colors are different between windows 8 &amp; windows 10. Doing other things in the meantime sounds good. I made a start menu in the meantime of a html project I had. <br /><br />I could help, but I'm not as good as you are with .skin making. x3<br /><br />Thanks for complementing me saying I'm computer savvy. ^-^ <br />I'm so so I'd say. <br /><br />I could try to find the direct links for those, yes. I'll take a look a bit later for you.<br /><br />Here is disk tidy: c:\windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe<br /><br />I looked in c:/windows/system32, but I didn't find any others. <br />I searched for ie.exe in c:/windows, and found ieexplore.exe in c:\windows\winsxs\wow64(very long file name here)<br /><br />Internet explorer is also in c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore.exe<br /><br />Will look again tomorrow for more.

The menu looks so dull and boring. <br />I think it's due to the default saturation level in Windows personalization control.<br />One background picture with auto color turned on, makes the tiles on my menu practically white. <br />Can't even read the fake text on it. Dang it. If I boost the color slider the white goes away.<br />I made a mistake in not making tiles original size. Looks so dinky. Too late now,<br />I'm not going back to rework them. I think I'm going to try and finish mine by the weekend, or trash it,<br />and work on house renovating instead. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
