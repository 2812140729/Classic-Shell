Does starting it from there put the button back on the taskbar and do you see it running in the Task Manager? If yes, then it's just not starting at startup reliably. Put a shortcut to that EXE in your startup folder. Check in Services.msc if the Classic Shell service is disabled. It should be set to Automatic and started. The service starts the Start Menu on Windows 8.

That one is nearer Win 8 in its presentation but giving the Win 7 access that I really needed.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help.
