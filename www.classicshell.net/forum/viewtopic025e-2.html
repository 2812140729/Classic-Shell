If you install the Classic Start Menu (which is just a regular app, safe to install as it doesn't modify any system files), you will get a regular Start Menu like Windows 7 or XP. There are 2 other components -  an addon for Windows Explorer to restore some features which were lost including a customizable toolbar and others, and an addon for Internet Explorer to restore page title and removed status bar features. All components are optional so you can choose during installation to only install the Start Menu.
