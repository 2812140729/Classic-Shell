You'll need the x86 and x64 versions if you want TrueTransparency borders on all applications on a x64 OS.

It would probably need to be from scratch anyways, because reactOS isnt quite as customizable as I'd like it to be <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, and thats windows xp anyways <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> Personally I think browser, and file explorer should merge into 1 <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, I would love to use google chrome for local browsing if it had just a handful more features <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (suprised it didnt turn out this way, when they made chromeOS)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2015 10:14 pm</p><hr />

I'd like to note that Vista Style Builder can convert XP, Vista, and 7 styles to and from one another. Windows 8/8.1 support is still in beta, and Windows 10 support is still tuned for the earlier builds. It's about as accurate as Google translate, but it's a start. Heck, I had a few converted XP themes working pretty smoothly on Windows 7, though they still kinda fell apart when DWM was active. Others completely exploded (aka having the caption bitmap floating directly above its intended location), but once again, it's a start. Vista styles seem to make the jump much more easily, so it could be said that desktop composition is the only major breaking point <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9454">Splitwirez</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2015 3:38 pm</p><hr />

Aside from the start menu being the actual focus of classic shell. (the toolbar is ok, but you can get that from just about any explorer toolbar)<br /><br />It would be quite difficult to 'salvage all the old themes' because there are simply different requirements on windows 10, fields and pieces that simply didn't exist in a previous version, or no-longer exist now. It would have to be done on a theme by theme basis. (basically you gotta deal with the glitches, until/if the themes creator decides to create a version for 10)<br /><br />Would I love to see a completely rebuilt explorer by Ivo, with all the cool features (like showing folder size, and customized skins) Sure; Though I think he has his hands full with the start menu...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2015 1:03 pm</p><hr />

Since on Windows 10, you seem to have figured out how to use the native aero implementation, I think it would be useful for Classic Shell to to have a built-in aero implementation for themes. I have also noticed that themes made for previous versions of Windows seem to have terrible animation glitches that also affect other parts of the OS under UXstyle. Maybe if you had an integrated theming system, it could rebuild those glitched themes to work properly with later versions of windows. It's a shame that all those old Windows XP, 7, and 8 themes are lost on windows 10 because of different programming.<br /><br />The reason I'm asking is because this is Classic &quot;Shell,&quot; not Classic Start Menu, which has a broader control of the OS, so it could very well have system themes and icon packs built for it without changing the type of project.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10797">phly95</a> — Sun Aug 09, 2015 10:25 am</p><hr />
