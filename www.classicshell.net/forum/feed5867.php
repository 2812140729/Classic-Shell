Some people can learn and retain the knowledge indefinitely. <br />Others like me, have a hard time learning, with an easy time forgetting it all. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />There are a few skins made already that can display an extra custom image.<br />Just point to a location of custom image on your hard drive, to load it:<br /><br />Metallic (7 style included in CSM)<br />Clasetro (7 style) <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=7025">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=7025</a><!-- l --><br />Asus K20 Evolution (7 style) <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=6255">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=6255</a><!-- l --><br />Startisback plain10 (7 style) <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=6769">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=6769</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Tweaking your image for size, brightness, and free blank space in an image editor, is pretty much all that's required. <br /><br /><br /><br />To make your own skin, with a built in image, is a lot more involved. It really has to be narrowed down to many details.<br />Type of menu - classic 1, classic 2, or 7 style.<br /><br />If 7 style, will image show on all three types of the main menu, jump view, search view, and main view, or just the main view? <br /><br />How will image be displayed? Image that shrinks, and expands,(distorts),<br />or tile repeat,(Pattern) <br />or show once only (Emblem) <br />or show many different images at different locations. <br />What dpi is your monitor. Higher dpi requires bigger images.<br />To show image full color, or show in alpha channel like watermark, and how much does image blend in with the original menu.<br />Usually one or more mask images have to be made as well, to block, or show where the extra image is seen.<br /><br /><br /><br />If all this is far above ones head, you may not even need to have it so complicated. <br />Say if all you want is to have a small logo above shutdown button, like the Alienware head logo,<br />then copy off the sample 7 style Metro Alienware logo skin, or swap out the images.<br /><br />The text was added at the very bottom of skin file. <br />The png images are medium size image 101, and small icon size image 102. It's only set up for standard 96 dpi.<br />Can work higher dpi, but image will be smaller proportion.<br /><br /><br /><br />There is another way too. Just build image right into the main menu bitmap, <br />with slice dimensions to stop that menu corner from changing shape,(distorting).<br /><br />It's best to do a simple sketch on a menu screenshot to see what you want.<br />The weekend is almost over. I may not be able to help much. Other experienced ones might be able to help out. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Sun May 28, 2017 8:54 am</p><hr />

I am working on a theme for my computer and not sure how to do the skinning, kinda confusing for me....but basically I am using the Metro skin currently, and I would like something similar but with the Umbrella Corporation logo in the background.  as I said, the tutorial was quite confusing to me, so I figured I would ask for some help from the great people within this community...<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20422">tcdegenerate</a> — Sat May 27, 2017 7:51 pm</p><hr />
