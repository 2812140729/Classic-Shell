		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />With Big Muscle's Aero Glass package and a Windows 10 installation that does not itself blur the Taskbar, I find it's impossible to get Taskbar blur with Classic Shell version 4.2.2.  Not a big deal, but perhaps unintended.<br /><br />As far as I know, there's no promise yet that Microsoft is actually going to resurrect taskbar blur in the Win 10 release.  It's only been rolled out on some Win 10 preview systems to see how people like it, and mine was not one of them.<br /><br />The missing setting of the blur accent (with Aero Glass for Win 8.x) is thus the only way for me to get blurred translucency on my Win 10 test setup.<br /><br />-Noel

As I mentioned, not everyone's getting builds that have blur.  I believe they're looking to find out which userbase submits happier responses (and of course, we can't possibly have an option - that would be too Windows 7-like).<br /><br />But hey, no worries, leave it until release time and restore it if Microsoft chooses not to deliver blur.  <br /><br />I keep my colors pretty dark and I can certainly work with a taskbar that has no blur until then.<br /><br /><img src="../../noel.prodigitalsoftware.com/ForumPosts/Win10/10159/TaskbarNoBlur.png" alt="" /><br /><br />-Noel

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't think that's true. Every build for the last 2-3 months I tried has had blur on both the taskbar and the start menu. There isn't any randomness in it. I have seen some glitches where the opacity switches between multiple levels of blur, however it is always there.<br /><br />You may be having a problem with your video card or driver. Also it is possible that AeroGlass is messing with the taskbar, most likely unintentionally. Try uninstalling it and see if you get the glass effect on the taskbar.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, the problem remains without Aero Glass in the system at all.  I meant to say that in my last post, since you had asked, but just forgot.<br /><br />I don't expect you to do or fix anything; I'm just here to try to help.  Maybe it's just a bug in Microsoft's code and not worth any worry at all - though I am now seeing reports of it from others as well.  I just figured I ought to let you know about it.<br /><br />If/when Microsoft releases Win 10 without a working blur - and you'd better believe they have all kinds of &quot;trollish plans&quot; (that's putting it nicely) - it might be a Good Thing (as before) if you could restore the functionality that allowed the Taskbar accent to be set, which in turn would make the Aero Glass tool effective at restoring translucency blur.  Even if not, life will go on.  It's not the worst thing about the disjointed mess that is Windows 10.  Not by a long shot.<br /><br />-Noel

BTW, you should remove the CompatibilityFixes value from the registry. It is applies to specific version of Classic Shell, so the same value in the registry will enable another shim in another version of the software. You don't want that.
