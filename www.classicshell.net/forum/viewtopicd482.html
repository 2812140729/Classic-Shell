	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm wondering if the problem I'm having is either related to Classic Shell or if can be fixed by adjusting a Classic setting.<br /><br />Here's what's happening: the vast majority of the time, whenever I try to drag &amp; drop files from one folder to another while pressing the right mouse button in Explorer (to change the behavior from the default to either explicit copy or move), the Explorer context menu almost immediately takes over, effectively making drag &amp; drop impossible (although every once in a while it works correctly). This only happens on my Windows 10 Pro (1703) machine, and never happens on my Windows 7 Pro computers.<br /><br />In the full settings for the Classic Start Menu (v4.3.1), there's an item under the &quot;General Behavior&quot; tab named: <strong>&quot;Drag/drop hide delay</strong>&quot;. Now, this <em>sounds to me</em> like what it does is increase the time it takes while waiting for a possible drag &amp; drop operation before the explorer context menu &quot;takes over&quot;. But the description that shows up while hovering doesn't seem to agree with that concept, but it's a bit ambiguous. So the first question is: Can anyone provide a fuller explanation of just what that setting does and if it's germane to my problem?<br /><br />And if it's not relevant, is there a Classic Shell setting that would help resolve this problem?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br /><br /><hr /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;"><strong>It turned out that the problem was my mouse!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> </strong></span></span><br /><br />It's decades old -- it's a Logitech Trackman Marble, which they stopped making many years ago, but I had to keep using it because it's by far my favorite mouse.<br /><br />Here's what must have been happening: The internal switch under the right mouse button was giving intermittent contact. So when Explorer &quot;saw&quot; even a brief electrical disconnection, it looked as if I had stopped pressing down on the right button, so it correctly switched from Drag &amp; Drop mode into Context Menu mode.<br /><br />Just a few minutes ago I connected a different mouse, and the problem went away!<br /><br />Thanks to all for your patience!

Yes, those are the same settings &amp; values I have. But clearly I'm too stupid to understand how that answers my questions. Perhaps you wouldn't mind elaborating, please?<br /><br />For example, does that <strong>&quot;Drag/drop hide delay</strong>&quot; setting actually control the time it takes waiting for a possible drag &amp; drop operation before the explorer context menu &quot;takes over&quot;? Or does it do something else, such as control the delay for dragging something out from the context menu itself to the desktop or folder before the menu closes, which is what the confusing description says?  I ask because changing that value, even massively, does not appear to make any difference in what I'm describing in my OP.<br /><br />Please help me understand your response. Thank you.

The mouse wire would break at the entry point of body.<br />It would work most of the time. I go through cheap mice every couple of years.<br /><br />One expensive Microsoft wireless mouse, I wore out the left button. I really had to click it hard to make electrical contact. I unsoldered both the left and right switches, reversed positions, <br />and resoldered. Still use it to this day. Got to be 10 years old now!<br /><br />Yeah, sometimes it's oxide buildup on the switch contacts, or the metal elements just wore down,<br />from thousands of hits.
