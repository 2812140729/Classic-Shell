False issue, can be closed: It was my cpu fan that somehow got loose (one of the bracket pin's was broken).<br />That way the cpu fan came a few mm from the cpu, meaning that didnt cool anymore, causing crashes.<br />Was a pain to find.<br /><br />Anyways: hardware trouble, not software <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Sorry for the inconvenience.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=490">ezwz</a> — Mon Mar 25, 2013 1:17 am</p><hr />

Doesn't seem like your BSOD is related to Classic Shell. It doesn't mess with the Windows settings and doesn't leave any code behind after uninstall.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Fri Mar 22, 2013 8:32 am</p><hr />

Hi, i use windows 8 pro. I used an upgrade from windows 7.<br />My wife asked me to do something about the metro style of windows 8 since she simply can't find stuff she knows is on the pc.<br />I game a lot and have game on the system called Runes of Magic. <br /><br />So, yesterday, i installed classic shell: looked good, exactly what my wife needed. Fidled with some skins etc, all nice.<br />Then i went on to play the game and after just a few minutes in game my complete system crashed with a blue screen of death (with the sad smiley).<br />This never happened before. Anyways, i thought i best give it the benefit of the doubt, so i tried again, crashed again and did it once more for good measure and crashed again.<br /><br />I then &quot;quited&quot; the classic shell before starting the game. So i don't have the logo as start button anymore, but the system still crashes.<br /><br />Well, who knows, maybe the classic shell and this game just don't go together, stuff happens. So i decide to de-install classic shell and reboot after that (it said it needed to to completely remove all changes).<br />However, the system still keeps crashing after just a few min's ingame.<br />The installation of the game itself didnt change and i haven't installed anything else in the last few days.<br /><br />So my question is really, could it be that the de-install left something behind that my system can't handle ok?<br />Is there anything i can try to get this to work again next to a complete re-install?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=490">ezwz</a> — Fri Mar 22, 2013 6:34 am</p><hr />
