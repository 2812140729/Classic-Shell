		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Gif supports 256 colors only, with a transparency.. its not an 8-bit transparency.. gifs look bad..<br /><br />Gifs should already be obsolete.. 256 colors is already too out-dated... everything is already 32-bit, even the Windows Icons.. Gif was for a bygone era when alot of things were 256, and that seemed normal to us.. <br /><br />APNG support for Orbs would be cool<br /><br />and since APNG is all done via command line, it would seem it'd be possible to create a sort of APNG interface of your own, built into Clasic Shell... designed around the Open-Source APNG Assembler, APNGasm, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apngasm/files/" class="postlink">http://sourceforge.net/projects/apngasm/files/</a> or maybe <strong><a href="http://littlesvr.ca/apng/assembler-2.0/assembler2.php" class="postlink">this</a></strong><br /><br />you could simply specify a normal APNG command, and it would compile &amp; use that compiled APNG file for the Start Orb..<br /><br />anyway.. who doesnt want a 32-bit animation with an 8-bit transparency? its ridiculous that APNG isnt already as common and easy to use as Gif, Jpeg, &amp; PNG.. HTML5 widely seems to support APNG, as do most things following HTML5 standards... so, something seems a bit fishy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Even though Classic Shell is widely appealing to the Windows 8 users, and most windows 8 systems are tablets and laptop devices, its still used widely for Desktops<br /><br />APNG has several advantages, not the least of all is its beauty.  Just like when you watch tv, and suddenly a small preview shows up about what show is coming up next.. totally transparent.. those are shot in Blue or Green Screen then keyed out to transparency, from the Video.. but APNG could look exactly like that, as high quality as you see on those HD TV shows<br /><br />this means that Companies could offer their own cool interfaces for Start Menu Orbs, or other interactive widgets or gadgets, which, when clicked, begin a high-quality 32-bit Animation with 8-Bit transparency, that makes it look visually stunning..<br /><br />Its a Great Sales, Marketing &amp; Advertising Opportunity for companies to make cool things that look awesome on your screen when clicked or moused over<br /><br />they could come built-in to certain computers.. companies could cover half the cost of your device if you buy the &quot;McDonald's&quot; Tablet that has animated Hamburglers when u click certain objects..<br /><br />anyway.. i just cant see why its not being used.. without going into conspiracy theories
