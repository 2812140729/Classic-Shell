Never tried it.<br />It does work with a standard hex number.<br /><br /><br />Good luck <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yup. Splitwirez is correct.<br /><br />Sometimes it's very easy to just change a text word, or hex number.<br />In this case, because some of the the main menu, search, and jump have gradients, <br />and maybe I'm wrong, almost everything that uses transparency,<br />needs to be real 32 bit bitmap image. You will have to get down and dirty, <br />and put the bitmaps through an image editor that saves/exports as 32 bit.<br />The bitmaps will not look like the menu, as they are shrunk down.<br />You need to cut the white part out, and copy the merged RGBalpha fom right side to left part of bitmap.<br />Change the opacity text from glass to fullglass.<br />Most of the other stuff is copy/pasting text from &quot;main2&quot;, making it read as &quot;main&quot; <br /><br />I'm off tommorow, I'll check back to see if you get somewhere with it.<br />If stuck, I can help out with pointers, or just do it for you, if you get stressed out from it. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

(the base color, with alpha transparecy level)<br />I made the bitmap 2 all same red gradient. (the red mask, that uses the system glass color)<br /><br />Found out after doing the same to the search, and jump bitmaps, they all look the same. <br />I did not need to modify the other bitmaps 8,9,13,14. Just change text to reuse bitmap 1 and 2.<br /><br />Tell you what, I can only torture a person for so long, before helping out.<br />I'll put the modded two bitmaps in a zip for you to replace in the skin file.<br />Here is some of the text changes that I made in the script&#058;<br /><br />Main_bitmap=1<br />;Main_bitmap_search=8<br />;Main_bitmap_jump=13<br />Main_bitmap_search=1<br />Main_bitmap_jump=1<br /><br />Main_bitmap_mask=2<br />;Main_bitmap_search_mask=9<br />;Main_bitmap_jump_mask=14<br />Main_bitmap_search_mask=2<br />Main_bitmap_jump_mask=2<br /><br />Main_opacity=fullglass<br />Main2_opacity=fullglass<br /><br />;Main_bitmap_slices_X=11,2,3,4,2,24<br />Main_bitmap_slices_X=12,2,3,4,2,25<br />Main_bitmap_search_slices_X=11,2,35<br />Main_bitmap_jump_slices_X=12,2,3,4,2,25<br /><br />If you can get past the important bitmap changes, you will have confidence to do the rest of it.<br /><br />If you throw in the towel, and give up, let me know, and I will upload the finished mod skin.

However, most fonts don't work with the skins it seems, like Super Mario 256 Bold, but that was just to test it. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />When referring to your modded bitmap 1, does the black corner define alpha? Because I saw no alpha layer in my editor. Just curious.<br /><br />And this is just greed talking, but does increasing or decreasing blur (in this case, increasing) have to do with bitmaps or the script? And uh, is there a way to add an open animation that isn't a fade in? Like a slide (or however you describe it) similar to 10's integrated Start? I'm only asking because the classic and classic w/ two columns styles have the ability for a fade in. I think I'm being just a tad bit greedy here... I apologize... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_geek.gif" alt=":geek:" title="Geek" /> If it can't be done, I can go without it.

It has to be loaded a certain way. Some do show it when it's a png file.<br /><br />One of the reasons I always use Pixelformer free program. <br />Pixelformer shows three views, regular red green blue, the alpha channel, and a combined merged view. Nothing hiding.<br /><br />For the alpha level, it's usually the alpha level in the bitmap that sets it.<br />In CSM settings, the only &quot;glass opacity&quot; in &quot;Menu Look&quot; tab, can be increased or decreased around the bitmap value.<br />I don't know of any animation text in a skin file. Who knows what Ivo has next. Can only adjust in CSM settings. <br /><br />You did very well.<br /><br /><br />Ah, what the hay, here is the modded skin from MPU.<br />Thanks MPU, for knowing Windows 10 would be going flat in the future.<br /><br />As the original submenu does not have glass color tint on the selector button,<br />I made an option to turn off the tint color on all the main menu buttons to match.<br /><br />I borrowed the scroll parts from Ivo's Midnight skin.<br /><br />Put an option for vertical separator on main menu.<br /><br />I left the submenu gap the way MPU had. If you want it to overlap more,<br />put this text &quot; Submenu_offset=5 &quot; in script after the submenu text, to overide it. <br /><br />Cleaned a couple of inconsistencies.<br /><br />Can always change the bitmap 1 transparency layer with Pixelformer.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

But if it wasn't for screwing up so much, <br />I wouldn't find unique ways of utilizing the bitmaps, and script.<br />Just don't put me in charge of a nuclear arsenal. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /><br />OK, I just realized after a windows update, that the inner &quot;new program highlight&quot; is white wonky, <br />as it was not designed for full glass background. <br />Not everybody likes the orange color. <br />It's not that difficult to change it in an image editor to the color you like, <br />just as long as it saves as 32bit, (.bmp) Then it won't be white anymore.<br /><br />If you want it still comic orange and fixed, it's in the revision B skin.<br />It has black text option, and some color on separators, and sub button.<br />Not for everyone. Still has MPU's character though.

Sorry if I don't understand, but is that an example or a skin attribute?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  But the black text option is interesting, doesn't fit well with black glass (captain obvious), but I like the option. Makes me wish things like this came WITH Windows and not something you had to install.

It has been in Windows menu for years and years.<br />When some people see it, they get repulsed by the color, and go on the forum, asking how to get rid of it.<br />Most of the time, it's because color does not make happy compliment with the glass color at that time. <br /><br />In the skins I modified, I went out of my way to make it look awful, nice, odd, wacko, rainbow color, invisible even. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Let me know if you want a different color. <br />I can make it so it looks just like regular button, if you want, so it does not clash with anything.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The theme, &quot;Mr GRiM's Dark7 Ultimate Theme for Windows 7&quot; makes many different elements of the UI dark, including the search bar. (And a handful of third party programs) When I changed the background mask to 0 in AeroFlat FullGlass, the outer edge of the search bar was white, but the text box remained black. Personally I have no preference for either a black or white search bar, but I do like the black one better. However, when it comes to searching, I usually use the search bar within File Explorer.
