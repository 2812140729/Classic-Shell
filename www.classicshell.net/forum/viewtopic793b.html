In fact, 3 machines so far out of a couple thousand. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I would like to include Classic Shell in any Win 8 / Server 2012 installations from hereon forward.<br /><br />I understand that it's 'free' for commercial use. HOWEVER, I want to make out clients pay. It's a great product, they have lots of money, it will make Windows 8ish OS acceptable for use in their business... but the cheapskates will NEVER donate, trust me.<br /><br />CAN I charge them some amount, and then turn around and DONATE that amount? I.e., is that permitted by the licensing.<br /><br />If so, what's a 'resasonable' amount in people's opinions. Don't say 10 cents. Don't say $100. I was thinking five bucks? ten bucks? What do you people think, and what do people usually donate for this sort of of (of the ones that bother to donate).

And for a couple of seats I don't think it matters.<br /><br />One thing I'll say is that donations less than a buck are not very useful because of the fees withheld by PayPal.

I feel you are just taking advantage of his kindness.<br /><br />I dont see a difference between selling it online, or selling it face to face.<br /><br />If you really think its so good people should pay for it, shouldnt you be requesting your clients send money to Ivo, rather than collecting the money yourself.<br /><br />and regardless of how much money sopmeone has, nobody should be paying for something thats free. Its a criminal act. <br /><br />Charging your clients to install a fantastic program, configure said program, update and customize it, add the useful tools and BAT commands etc so that its tailored to a specific office's need, does deserve pay. You can charge for that. Not for Classicshell.<br /><br />And if all you're doing is installing it as is, 10 bucks is pushing it, imo.<br /><br />and if you are customizing computers, adding commands, shortcuts, BATs, links, etc etc, $10 dollars isn't beginning to cover it, unless its for a large number of computers and done remotely maybe
