		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Once again thank you fonpaolo.<br /><br />Now I'm sure black/clear versions are more than enough for blingblow/others to personalize it more.<br />Like enlarging certain frames, turn off blending, turn off no reverse, chop out dead frames, <br />changing starting/hover/pressed states, and on and on.<br /><br />There are free online animated gif makers that can crop the image more, <br />do all kinds of things, but usually work with no transparency. <br />I read that the link where these images came from have been altered (color boosted), so they are not original. <br />Looks like Jcee has got hold of the real ones.<br /><br /><br />File size.<br />I think I saved with multipass optimization, but may not work anymore.<br />I'm guessing adding the alpha channel added another 8 bits,<br />as well as the rgb has redistribution of what looks like more active pixels? <br /><br />I actually got quite close to your more professional practices with editors.<br />In Adobe Elements, I turned on &quot;Auto smart fix&quot;, then copied that rgb image to the alpha channel.<br />With just a little bit of darkness around the flag. I increased gamma on alpha a little as well.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />fonpaolo<br /><br />Some people have complained that they want to use the start menu, by hovering over the visible image to open the start menu, as well as hover over a true zero transparent pixel at the corner to get to the special Winx menu(gather mostly power users). <br />On a regular three state start button, probably the middle hover image would suffice. <br />Shucks, no, depending on which corner the start button is, it would have to be each corner.<br />Anyway, for an animated start button, I assume it would be a few of the hover frames, <br />because it would take that long to get the mouse pointer in the corner to activate Winx. <br />Too few, those frames would have passed and won't trigger.<br /><br />Anyway, I think we have done enough. It could even be detrimental for some people like me. <br />I'm as sloppy as trying to play guitar, as reaching for the start button, <br />I just fly over there to right click to get the Classic Shell context menu and end up getting Winx instead. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Looking back at your Avengers skin, it would be very difficult to implement stuff like that in a Classic Shell menu.

(hoping for the best)<br /><br />Something I can't even think about, as it scares me and also I'll finish it when Windows 1000 will be already rather outdated, if even it will still exists!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, fonpaolo.<br />AS Jcee and I have found out, even moving a user picture has restrictions as to which style is used.<br />The biggest problem is the menu can't be locked down to a preset size. <br />Ivo did put in provisions for some size settings in Win 7 style. Still, the menu is always going to stretch. <br />Emblems don't stretch, which is good. I've had plans in my head to make outrageous menu skins,<br />only to find they can't be done, and give up. <br />It really has to be simplified down to one/two columns of text with a little eye candy.
