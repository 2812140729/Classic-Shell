		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />IE still seems to be my first choice, especially for business/MS office. Just more integrated.<br />Firefox good for most things. Had a memory leak problem for awhile. Really slowed down on old computers.  <br />Plugins work well. e.g. Ant video downloader simple to use, where as IE plugin terrible.<br />Gave up on Chrome many times. Haven't tried for at least a year. Incompatibilities overode it's great speed.<br />Opera worked quite well at work on Win 2000, as OS would not allow newer IE upgrades.<br />Got XP last year with IE. Now use thin client with IE. <br /><br />Head of IT said no Win8 at the company. Will skip and wait and see Win9.<br /><br />At home, can always turn the tooty fruity colors off. Make it battleship grey. Probably an app to change color of tiles.<br />Make them all small and it ain't that bad. <br /><br />One doesn't have to use Chrome to get the targeted adds. Using Google search, same thing. <br />Funny when adds show up on sites I've never gone to, <br />for the items I looked at yesterday at an online store.<br /><br />Just like this site, the Bingbots and Googlebots busy at work browsing and crawling though our text.<br />Spiders everywhere in the web. Look at bottom of page. There might be one as you read this. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I much prefer the same functions in IE. IE is the only browser who's Favorites will show and be added in the Windows Start Menu. I also find it ironic that you have to add a bunch of extensions to the default FF to make it as secure as IE is out of the box. I will never use anything like NoScript for the same reason I will not use a classic HIPS application. Usability and convenience trumps everything else for me.

But Firefox's UI also keeps changing constantly, lately Mozilla have been making Firefox dumbed down, making annoying changes and keeping options only in about&#058;config or entirely removing from there as well.<br /><br />Chrome is just too minimalistic (no &quot;Match whole word&quot; or &quot;Match case&quot; in the Find dialog, seriously?). Opera was excellent till 12.xx but had many UI related bugs and then Opera pulled a Windows 8 with version 15 and turned into Chromium. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I mean seriously? Giving up Presto, and everything they had developed so far?<br /><br />I do keep all the major browsers installed because IE isn't perfect either. But being a usability obsessed person, I find IE &gt; Opera 12.x &gt; Chrome &gt; Firefox. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

Avast is pretty good at it and to all evidences, getting even better. MSE is not very good at all, just read the reviews. <br /><br />I'm talking about blocking the new zero day stuff. A technology that restricts or blocks anything new and unknown is the best way to go in my opinion as long as it's kept up to date and safe things are quickly recognized as such. Comodo is excellent in that regard. The others still rely mainly on detection by signatures which obviously doesn't work against the new things. Avast is about to add whitelisting in their 2014 product. I'm not sure if it's going to be in the free version but if it is, that will be a huge step forward.

But Firefox's UI also keeps changing constantly, lately Mozilla have been making Firefox dumbed down, making annoying changes and keeping options only in about&#058;config or entirely removing from there as well.<br /><br />Chrome is just too minimalistic (no &quot;Match whole word&quot; or &quot;Match case&quot; in the Find dialog, seriously?). Opera was excellent till 12.xx but had many UI related bugs and then Opera pulled a Windows 8 with version 15 and turned into Chromium. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I mean seriously? Giving up Presto, and everything they had developed so far?<br /><br />I do keep all the major browsers installed because IE isn't perfect either. But being a usability obsessed person, I find IE &gt; Opera 12.x &gt; Chrome &gt; Firefox. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br />So SeaMonkey is a great choice it uses the FF layout engine and all

It has almost none. What they are calling &quot;false positives&quot; are new and unknown things being restricted by the behavior blocker or auto sandboxing. A real false positive is something being detected by antivirus signatures as malware when it isn't. That very rarely happens. <br /><br />Most of the testers are not familiar with the way Comodo works because it takes a different approach than other products. Therefore they say it produces &quot;false positives&quot; because they really don't know what is going on. Only new or unknown things will be restricted and most of them will quickly be white listed if they are found to be safe.  That is not a false positive but rather a notice that the file is unknown to the system. All you need to do if you get a restriction alert for something you know is safe is tell the program not to restrict it again and restart the application. It will be in the trusted list from then on.
