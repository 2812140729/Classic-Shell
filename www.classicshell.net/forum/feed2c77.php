<span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">Classic Shell Sourceforge Reviews:</span> <br /><br />, November 27, 2010, 1:41:58 | Can't live without the up button! Classic Explorer works wonderfully for me. Please be wary of the thumb down reviews: The perpetrators of many of those idiotic reviews are of the opinion that Microsoft must be rimmed. <br /><br /><br />, November 24, 2010, 10:41:53 | Fantastic piece of software that brings back most of the goodness that Windows 7 lost in translation ! <br /><br /><br />, November 22, 2010, 11:39:50 | Best tweak ever! I am using it on a netbook with W7 Starter. I hate how new menu has scroll bars. I think the person who invented the new start menu was either mentally sick, high on drugs or really drunk. Classic Start Menu offers the best usability, somebody please tell MS to stop re-inventing the bicycle. Cheers. <br /><br /><br />, November 17, 2010, 8:58:03 | Very good work, thank you. This is not only to feel in old XP-version, the usability is much better. <br /><br /><br />, November 17, 2010, 8:46:57 | cool <br /><br /><br />, November 13, 2010, 2:10:28 | Wonderful! Deactivated Breadcrumbs! Show current path in Title Bar when Aero is activated (not only in classic view)! Loads of &quot;I want my WinXP back&quot; options! Great Work! <br /><br /><br />, November 10, 2010, 12:40:52 | It is a great tool that solves many issues in Windows Explorer. The most important two are: - It fixes the folder scrolling to the bottom of the screen after expanding it. - It adds automatic refresh of the right pane when you are navigating the folder tree with the arrow keys. <br /><br /><br />, November 08, 2010, 9:47:22 | BRILLIANT, thank you so much!!! <br /><br /><br />, November 07, 2010, 8:47:31 | OpenID Userexcellent! <br /><br /><br />, November 05, 2010, 8:39:01 | Sayat Ibraimovnice program. Very useful <br /><br /><br />, November 04, 2010, 7:25:01 | excellent, it works ; personnalising the toolbar is not easy, though <br /><br /><br />, November 04, 2010, 7:07:08 | orbidiaThis is better than any Start Menu that Microsoft has ever made. With version 2.90, it is super easy to totally customize every aspect of the Classic Start Menu. I can't believe I can finally make the Start Menu behave exactly how I want! I wish most programs in the world were this well done. It is stable, fast, easy to use and its skinnable too. I usually don't pay for freeware but this one deserves the support of the community. If you use this regularly, please contribute monetarily to the author. I say this because when future versions of Windows come out, I hope Classic Shell is still updated. We all know Microsoft is not going to bring the Classic Start Menu back or a bunch of the Explorer usability features. Classic Shell is a no brainer. I still can't believe the developer is offering this for free... it really is that great. <br /><br /><br />, November 02, 2010, 2:04:06 | perfect!! Thanx a lot for this cool software! Post-XP-Explorers suck! <br /><br /><br />, November 02, 2010, 1:12:58 | Thanks for the classic menu Windows Explorer. <br /><br /><br />, November 01, 2010, 11:02:20 | Fantastic!! It gives me back my XP! <br />, October 31, 2010, 10:18:39 | There is no real CONS for this apps. Some people just argue... blablabla, fear of changes... We don't have any fear about changes... YOU MUST understand that not all changes are good, specially with the weirds and sometimes illogicals choices of Microsoft. More stupids options is still... more stupids options... Why doing heavy and clunky when it can be sweet and simple It as always been the MAIN problem with microsoft... so many flaws in their designs... <br /><br /><br />, October 28, 2010, 1:21:24 | D9IDbKAПускай идут нахер олени использующие станданртный эксплорер, меню пуск и alt+shift всегда их лошил и лошить буду. Thank you for this wonderful program. Respect man <br /><br /><br />, October 27, 2010, 7:38:55 | С первого дня использования Se7en OS я мечтал об этой программе. Спасибо вам огромное. <br /><br /><br />, October 25, 2010, 6:19:43 | If i ever get round to using windows 7 i would install this straight after the os is installed. But until then Windows 7 has a long way to go before it beats windows XP. I have many great video hardware and such that xp knows but am told Windows 7 doesn't know. New hardware there is none for these new smaller motherboards that are 64 bit. Not even for pci-x it is all still pci, great for xp but for no other os. Actually i download this now, to remind me what it is called. So will get newer version if ever use vista, windows 7 or newer based on the same. <br /><br /><br />, October 23, 2010, 9:08:50 | Awesome! <br /><br /><br />, October 21, 2010, 8:44:21 | One of the best projects all around! It's even not possible to thank fully for this job done - Classic Shell makes it possible to get back to serious work, and not to fiddle endlessly through useless colorfull gadgets. Once again - many thanks guys! My greatest appreciations! G. <br /><br /><br />, October 19, 2010, 4:42:16 | Sam GleskeGreat job! I'm recommending this to all my friends. <br /><br /><br />, October 18, 2010, 6:36:43 | Molto comodo e pratico, utile per ridurre lo stress delle persone abituate ad XP a digerire le grafiche di windows 7. (capi e segretarie comprese)... <br /><br /><br />, October 16, 2010, 11:40:06 | FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! <br /><br /><br />, October 13, 2010, 10:39:12 | LenA very useful project. <br /><br /><br />, October 11, 2010, 1:11:34 | very useful tool, thanks for developing, shame on Microsoft, that they made it necessery! <br /><br /><br />, October 03, 2010, 7:10:56 | When I saw &quot;Classic Shell&quot; I think in Program Manager for Vista and 7 xD <br /><br /><br />, September 30, 2010, 1:11:23 | Thank you for giving me my Start menu back. Easy to install and use it has even advandced features, all of witch are really well documented and explained. <br /><br /><br />, September 26, 2010, 6:57:29 | I didn't buy Windows 7 before I found this application. Will try to donate money when times are easier. Thank you very much for your hard work. The up-arrow is easily the best feature to get back. Always at the same spot. You don't have to analyze where to click. Only one click and you're up one-level. Simple and effective. <br /><br /><br />, September 26, 2010, 5:07:13 | You basically fixed what Microsoft screwed up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. <br /><br /><br />, September 25, 2010, 11:21:20 | macro codersthanks <br /><br /><br />, September 23, 2010, 12:58:06 | Awesome! Thank you! Sometimes new and &quot;better&quot; is good but most of the time it sucks! Thanks again! <br /><br /><br />, September 21, 2010, 11:29:32 | Glorious. I created an account just to add my support for this. Lightweight, clean, customizable, and everything I was looking for to restore Win 7 to usability. Thank you to everyone involved! <br /><br /><br />, September 19, 2010, 9:17:35 | cool <br /><br /><br />, September 19, 2010, 1:14:42 | This is simply brilliant! <br /><br /><br />, September 19, 2010, 6:39:07 | Excellent, much needed alternative to the cramped, tiny new start menu. <br /><br /><br />, September 19, 2010, 12:21:26 | Classic Shell was the killer application that made us roll out Windows 7 in our company. @Microsoft: please check how many companies use this tool and think again! <br /><br /><br />, September 16, 2010, 1:33:22 | LOVE IT! Thank you, thank you and thank you! <br /><br /><br />, September 14, 2010, 10:37:13 | This is soo great, I owe you a beer! <br /><br /><br />, September 13, 2010, 3:17:48 | Travis RobinsonSleek and simple; just like XP. Thanks! <br /><br /><br />, September 07, 2010, 6:36:19 | paulbAWESOME. Shame on MS for removing user control, but mega thanks to you for bringing it back. <br /><br /><br />, September 06, 2010, 11:05:44 | Great program, thanks very much for it!. I missed some funcionality in Win 7 Explorer and Start Menu. Classic shell is THE answer for it! <br /><br /><br />, September 05, 2010, 11:33:27 | Perfect... I can't really say much more. To be honest, the new setting commands are a bit more abstruse than the previous version, but are worth devoting five minutes to resolve! I keep looking to see if there are updates, but I don't know why: everything it perfect as it is! Thanks for creating this absolutely essential program! <br /><br /><br />, September 02, 2010, 11:48:20 | Thanks. Now win7 is usable. Before it was a NON professional OS suitable for gamers and mp3s only. Now I can get some work done <br /><br /><br />, September 02, 2010, 12:53:30 | good work <br />, August 31, 2010, 11:17:33 | quick and easy to see the large files that you forgot or didn't know about. <br /><br /><br />, August 27, 2010, 3:37:38 | Scott PiazzaI could throw together volumes of technopraise poetry or song, but why waste so much time? Press the &quot;Download Now!&quot; - now. This app makes me feel better every time I use my computer. Isn't it time for you to feel better too? <br /><br /><br />, August 26, 2010, 10:20:12 | Thank you for the perfect Windows Classic Shell! My &quot;Must-have-Tool-2010&quot;! I like to switch between the Classic Menu and the new Windows 7 Menu, so I can use the good features from the new, and the perfect features of the old. And the &quot;More Settings&quot; is easy to use, too. Now my Windows is individual styled, and I like it. <br /><br /><br />, August 21, 2010, 8:59:50 | Thank you so much! It works perfectly and I love it. <br /><br /><br />, August 20, 2010, 5:37:22 | OpenID Userworks wonderfully, i just wish they added the classic network activity indicator, that could make it an awesome all-in-one solution! <br /><br /><br />, August 19, 2010, 11:55:29 | Absolutely flipping brilliant! I love it! <br /><br /><br />, August 19, 2010, 6:00:09 | SUPERB <br /><br /><br />, August 18, 2010, 5:55:48 | Excellent! The most useful thing is ability to quick jump to desired program by first letter. The annoying Win 7 start typing into search box, which is very frustrating if you do not want it! <br /><br /><br />, August 15, 2010, 9:10:36 | nice work!. thanks man. <br /><br /><br />, August 15, 2010, 6:35:52 | Max PashkovI hate Windows 7 because it's uncomfortable, but now I'll try it <br /><br /><br />, August 13, 2010, 4:55:12 | great, thx <br /><br /><br />, August 13, 2010, 10:27:49 | Excellent project, pass it around for goodness sake. Cheers. <br /><br /><br />, August 10, 2010, 2:16:38 | This is awesome. Works without any crashes <br /><br /><br />, August 08, 2010, 12:49:19 | The horribly cramped menu offered in Microsoft Windows 7 makes navigating a pain. And so many features that we've gotten used to in previous versions of Windows have been removed from Windows 7 as to make it difficult to do what used to be easy. Classic Menu and Classic Shell restore the easy navigation and many features that we need -- as well as offering wonderful and long-needed enhancements. These are great tools! <br /><br /><br />, July 28, 2010, 10:21:26 | cppNickThis thing is great, I love the styles, and it runs perfectly smooth. I would definitely recommend this. I can't stand that bulky monstrosity that we (were) forced to use before =) <br /><br /><br />, July 28, 2010, 1:38:37 | RyanThis program allows one to not only change the start menu in windows 7 to look like like the classic start menu in XP and windows 2000 but you can also change all aspects/items and placement of items in said menu. The program is small in file size, easy to use, does its job well and amazingly it's free (very rarely do you get those last 2 together)! Note: Some ini files will need to be edited manually to get the full effect of this program <br /><br /><br />, July 27, 2010, 7:34:46 | This is a great, great app. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves not to include this kind of functionality from the &quot;start&quot; (no pun intended). They should pay the developer here for massively improving the usability of Win7. <br /><br /><br />, July 27, 2010, 3:40:32 | thanks <br /><br /><br />, July 27, 2010, 1:41:32 | the best <br /><br /><br />, July 26, 2010, 1:12:27 | After installing W7 it took me some time to find a proper antidotum against the MS idiotic &quot;improval&quot; of the Start-button and Win-Eplorer. But it was worth searching --- Classic Shell is the key irreplacable SW, absolutely necessary for a rational every-day work with W7. Thank you very much, excellet work. If I could I would give you 10-thumb-ups! <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><br />, July 24, 2010, 7:51:06 | Thanks very, very much! Excellent add-on. <br /><br /><br />, July 24, 2010, 5:16:38 | The app that allowed me to finally move from XP to Win7. One request - I would love to have the &quot;keep taskbar on top of other windows&quot; option put into Classic Shell (which MS removed) so I can have my program windows on top of the taskbar again - autohide does not cut the mustard, esp has I have the taskbar on the left over 1/3 of the screen <br /><br /><br />, July 23, 2010, 11:56:57 | This is great, thank you! <br /><br /><br />, July 22, 2010, 1:01:11 | Thank you very much for the Classic Start Menu. It is an essential tool to creating a very useful and cool Start Menu. <br /><br /><br />, July 21, 2010, 11:39:48 | The missing puzzle. Makes Windows 7 tolerable. <br /><br /><br />, July 21, 2010, 1:04:40 | Perfect ! if more skins to choose, even more perfect... <br /><br /><br />, July 19, 2010, 4:11:42 | jim63Fantastic tool. Very many thanks for his continuing development. Jim. <br /><br /><br />, July 18, 2010, 12:14:05 | Simply can't do without. <br /><br /><br />, July 14, 2010, 3:19:31 | Beautiful! Just what I wanted! <br /><br /><br />, July 12, 2010, 12:41:22 | Leave it to 3rd parties to fix Microsofts stupidities... There is still about a dozen other things that need fixed in Win7. <br /><br /><br />, July 08, 2010, 11:55:09 | perfect! <br /><br /><br />, July 08, 2010, 12:23:45 | Suppa !!! <br /><br /><br />, July 06, 2010, 2:17:45 | wonderful project.now i start using windows 7. i use classic shell menu and royale theme for windows 7. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://satukoro.deviantart.com/art/Royale-port-to-Win7-Aero-158227540">http://satukoro.deviantart.com/art/Roya ... -158227540</a><!-- m --> thanksssssssssssssss <br /><br /><br />, June 29, 2010, 12:42:11 | Awesome, This actually makes Vista usable! If I was a MS developer, I would likely bury my head in the sand for not offering this simple option. Thanks to the guys responsible for this! <br /><br /><br />, June 28, 2010, 7:51:39 | Works great, so much nicer than the newer craptacular interfaces. <br /><br /><br />, June 28, 2010, 7:46:39 | in a word...heaven <br /><br /><br />, June 28, 2010, 3:48:09 | Thank you so much. The program installed flawlessly and popped open my programs folder. It was like finding an old friend. Why did M'soft ever leave this functional and simple interface. Thanks for bringing it back!! My pleasure to make a small donation to your work. Keep it up. <br /><br /><br />, June 26, 2010, 4:10:01 | THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH to whoever did this. I will be donating with paypal. Microsoft really needs to appreciate whoever did this, as this was my biggest complaint, and main reason I did not upgrade any of my pcs to win7 until now. I just wanted my UP button back, and now it seems I have full functionality (and control) of my system back! <br /><br /><br />, June 24, 2010, 7:35:24 | Great Project Very useful <br /><br /><br />, June 21, 2010, 3:31:06 | Cannot locate where to report bugs - right clicking on LH tree directory names/icons crashes any app using this. Please fix asap Thanks! Using Win 7 v6.1.7600 <br /><br /><br />, June 16, 2010, 1:24:30 | ChewyAhhh, The Monkey on my back is dead. Nice Work! <br /><br /><br />, June 15, 2010, 4:02:46 | I can finally go back to using my computer the way &quot;I&quot; want to <br /><br /><br />, June 14, 2010, 5:54:39 | The fact that I couldn't change to the classic style start menu was driving me nuts, I'm so glad I found this! Thank you! <br /><br /><br />, June 11, 2010, 8:42:06 | Excellent program! Now I can use the start menu the way I want. <br /><br /><br />, June 10, 2010, 10:33:25 | Helped my users wean themselves off of older versions of windows. Awesome! <br /><br /><br />, June 09, 2010, 5:26:41 | Just love it <br /><br /><br />, June 06, 2010, 6:46:42 | Great work. It was the first thing I looked for after installing Windows7. Just got there from XP64, so I missed all the annoying fun in Vista. Menu speed could be implemented in GUI for less experienced users (if such are bothering to find and install this nice utility). Thanks a lot. <br /><br /><br />, June 03, 2010, 11:41:30 | not everything whats new is better. this tool bring my lovely statusbar back !! <br /><br /><br />, June 03, 2010, 4:55:33 | looks good! <br /><br /><br />, June 02, 2010, 6:01:26 | I enjoy the 'XP' asthetics that Classic Shell adds to my Start Menu Applications. I no longer have to scroll through my applications as they now lay right before me in one vision. My regards for this applications writer's, as it is the dog's doo-dah's. Thank you for letting my Start Menu become more practical. =TriggaHappy= <br /><br /><br />, May 31, 2010, 7:12:05 | This Programm was the Reason for me to change to Windows 7 (from XP, on three Systems!). <br /><br /><br />, May 28, 2010, 9:19:20 | Man, thanks SO MUCH!!! You fixed what those retards at MS screwed up. Now my Vista-crapista laptop is actually usable. Thank you!!! <br /><br /><br />, May 24, 2010, 12:02:52 | hjp3This is the cure for the crippled Windows Explorer of Windows 7 I was looking for. Thank you. <br /><br /><br />, May 21, 2010, 5:36:05 | THANKS YOU A LOT! It's that, what I really need!!! <br /><br /><br />, May 17, 2010, 10:59:49 | I recently installed windows 7, because of the good reviews. However, when I found that the horrible new start menu can't be changed to the classic XP style one, I almost had a heart attack. After some searching, I found this project. It's perfect! Just what I was looking for. I even thought of different start menus with different mouse buttons, and, lo and behold, the option was there!. Thanks a lot, keep up the good work! <br /><br /><br />, May 13, 2010, 6:11:06 | My biggest frustration with Windows 7 / Vista have been the UI changes where usability has been entirely removed in the name of progress. This project allowed me to have access to the functionality and style that I prefer and am very grateful for everything that has been done to date. <br /><br /><br />, May 11, 2010, 10:28:45 | DJRigaLet's you pick &amp; choose which &quot;classic&quot; features you want to use. Great program!!! <br /><br /><br />, May 11, 2010, 4:39:17 | Wonderful, super, great Thanks <br /><br /><br />, May 11, 2010, 11:01:24 | thank you! <br /><br /><br />, May 09, 2010, 2:46:01 | Chuck ComputerdrThis little addon has helped many of my customers since I have found it. A lot of my customers that are finding they have to upgrade from XP to vista or 7 and they call me telling me they are lost and don't know how to get anywhere. I have started using this little app for them and it makes life a little easier for them to make the transition. It has even gotten me a couple of jobs into my shop because other people using their computer that feared upgrading for this very reason have chosen to upgrade after seeing this. I wanted the developer to know it has indeed help many of my older customers that don't like change much. ___________ Chuck <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myputerdr.com">http://www.myputerdr.com</a><!-- m --> <br /><br /><br />, May 05, 2010, 6:39:52 | Awesome! Kazactly what I lusted after! Did I already tell you it's awesome? Well, it's *awesome*! <br /><br /><br />, May 05, 2010, 12:46:00 | BrttThis is a winner ! <br /><br /><br />, May 05, 2010, 12:32:40 | I wanted what it does, it worked first try. Thanks! <br /><br /><br />, May 04, 2010, 11:51:23 | Finally a very good option to alleviate the ununderstandable lack of size-of-files-in-current-folders and <br />remaining space on current drive. Lovely ! <br /><br /><br />, May 02, 2010, 9:36:55 | Now this is what makes Windows 7 a great OS! <br /><br /><br />, April 25, 2010, 12:35:06 | Just what I needed. <br /><br /><br />, April 24, 2010, 12:34:30 | xeonBoys, you're great!! I love Classic Sheel!! Keep up the good work! <br /><br /><br />, April 22, 2010, 3:31:14 | the snownice !!! <br /><br /><br />, April 12, 2010, 5:36:00 | Merci ! Bravo !!! <br /><br /><br />, April 10, 2010, 1:31:56 | nice tool <br /><br /><br />, April 10, 2010, 9:12:47 | Works wonderfully, both start button AND explorer. (I like Explorer better.) <br /><br /><br />, April 08, 2010, 3:28:32 | Thank you so much for Classic Shell. It finally makes Windows 7 perfect. <br /><br /><br />, April 08, 2010, 8:33:05 | This is a slick app. Very professionally done with tons of options to work with. To the person who was concerned about the sub-folder menus in the root. That is a checkbox option in the configuration window. Hope this helps <br /><br /><br />, April 07, 2010, 6:31:59 | This makes Windows 7 tolerable! Thank you. <br /><br /><br />, April 07, 2010, 1:29:50 | simple but fantastic great work <br /><br /><br />, April 07, 2010, 1:09:46 | super <br /><br /><br />, April 04, 2010, 7:53:39 | Thank you sanity at last. Fantastic! Now we all need is something to replace the repetitive strain injury caused by open file save dialogs all over the screen in different folders and inconsistent views. <br /><br /><br />, April 01, 2010, 2:44:02 | Very good <br /><br /><br />, April 01, 2010, 8:37:04 | Chris ClawsonGreat utility. This fixes most of the problems I have with Explorer. <br /><br /><br />, April 01, 2010, 5:26:31 | Thank you so much for adding the classic windows up arrow. I am an advanced user, but I still find that up-arrow extremely convenient. In fact for me, this seemingly small unimportant factor-- the windows up one directory arrow, is something that i view as critical and important. I searched high &amp; low for an open source solution to my problem-- it's truly a shame microsoft got rid of this feature. maybe it's no surprise that 10+ years ago, all the most talented managers started leaving microsoft and heading over to google. Anyway, back to my point--I don't even use the classic windows menu--however, the up-arrow this application adds is extremely helpful to me. It's funny--there's an application called the mavis up-arrow, that costs $5, that only adds the up-arrow. However, this up-arrow matches the color and style of my windows 7 operating system--and it's free. Thanks a ton you guys. As a small token of my appreciation I have written this review. Hopefully, people start realizing this small, but very valuable sourceforge application is here-- classic shell. <br /><br /><br />, March 31, 2010, 9:11:31 | This is good. But if it could bring back the ability to turn off Auto Arrange on a folder to folder basis it would be amazing. <br /><br /><br />, March 30, 2010, 11:49:49 | Andrew SteinbornReally great. Been using since the 0.9.8 RC. <br /><br /><br />, March 30, 2010, 3:16:48 | Kai SchätzlThis is sooo cool! Thanks! <br /><br /><br />, March 29, 2010, 12:42:30 | OpenID UserSuper <br />, March 26, 2010, 12:10:45 | This is the best thing I've found since switching to windows 7 from XP. I was so pissed off at how MS took away all the XP features of navigation and now I've got it back. So awesome. Stop looking for other fixes and install this one!!!! <br /><br /><br />, March 25, 2010, 10:56:41 | Ohne dieses Tool wäre Windows 7 für'n Arsch <br /><br /><br />, March 25, 2010, 1:08:07 | Thank you so much for this! <br /><br /><br />, March 24, 2010, 4:57:15 | thx very good <br /><br /><br />, March 23, 2010, 11:54:29 | FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!! <br /><br /><br />, March 23, 2010, 6:36:04 | FANTASTIC !!!! The developers need a gold medal and loads of money from Microsoft for helping <br />improve their OS <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><br />, March 23, 2010, 12:59:32 | Simply the best <br /><br /><br />, March 21, 2010, 9:06:13 | Absolutely brilliant!...Worth paying for. <br /><br /><br />, March 20, 2010, 1:25:52 | Incredible as it is, it takes an independent programmer to rid us of &quot;improvements to the worse&quot; which M$ insists on for no good reason whatsoever. Kudos!!!! <br /><br /><br />, March 18, 2010, 7:15:22 | Thank you, thank you, thank you! After trying a couple supposedly comparable apps, and cursing on this new and &quot;improved&quot; Windows start menu more times than I can count, this was EXACTLY what I was looking for! <br /><br /><br />, March 18, 2010, 3:08:09 | Dmitry NazarovGreat program for Windows7! Thanks. <br /><br /><br />, March 18, 2010, 1:35:40 | Wow this is exactly what I was looking for. Has very nice set of features and seems stable. Love it!! Good job. <br /><br /><br />, March 16, 2010, 11:39:29 | Quick response and simple to use ... maybe interesting to provide some more skins ... <br /><br /><br />, March 15, 2010, 3:36:55 | I've been using Classic Shell for four months. It's done exactly what I wanted, and it's never caused any problems. I've tried most of the alternatives, but this one is the best. <br /><br /><br />, March 15, 2010, 2:10:29 | This is really a great contribution. A big tip of the hat for Classic Shell. <br /><br /><br />, March 11, 2010, 2:03:22 | Amazing, I can't thank you enough. CSMenu was ok... but this knocks CSMenu out of the park. This is perfect! <br /><br /><br />, March 10, 2010, 7:29:20 | Really nice program - now I if I could only get a replacement for Windows 2000 File Manger to work with Windows 7. I would be in heaven <br /><br /><br />, March 10, 2010, 5:32:39 | good! thanks a lot <br /><br /><br />, March 09, 2010, 3:23:46 | Classic shell is a must-have for Windows 7 users. <br /><br /><br />, March 09, 2010, 2:06:47 | GREAT SOFTWARE !!!!!!! <br /><br /><br />, March 08, 2010, 11:54:18 | Me gusto.... era lo que buscaba. <br />, March 07, 2010, 10:35:12 | intronFinally!! Thanks so much. Where is that donate button now? I can't gush about how much I needed this project to make Win7 workable at all. New menu style isn't just 'different' - its like making a track star wear concrete shoes. It is hard to imagine that in all of their testing no one said &quot;man, this sucks&quot;! Anyway... thanks again! <br /><br /><br />, March 05, 2010, 6:46:02 | Exactly what I was looking for! Great work, thanks a lot!!! <br /><br /><br />, February 28, 2010, 4:23:17 | Guys, thanks so much for this app!!! <br /><br /><br />, February 26, 2010, 2:51:34 | Excellent <br /><br /><br />, February 24, 2010, 11:07:29 | perfect! easy, fast and no bugs. I recommend. SANDREANO P SILVA from Brazil. <br /><br /><br />, February 23, 2010, 9:57:44 | Classic Shell is the BEST! I'm a power user as well as an instructor for blind and visually impaired <br />computer users. I am happy to say that Classic Shell works with screen reader programs such as Microsoft narrator, ZoomText, and JAWS (Job Access With Speech). Clasic Shell offers first letter navigation as well as drag-and-drop shortcuts from the desktop. The other emulators either lack or fall short of that feature. Keep up the good work. I'm rooting you on!!! <br /><br /><br />, February 23, 2010, 6:24:29 | Finally, Simple Folder View is back in Windows 7! Thanks to this little program. <br /><br /><br />, February 23, 2010, 9:32:15 | Awesome, It's a shame other have to fix what microsoft breaks <br /><br /><br />, February 21, 2010, 11:50:16 | mickyfoley@Kira san: Let the user decide, what is the correct way for them. Users like me prefer the oversight of the startmenu. Well sorted since years ans so it should stay. Classic Shell the top notch of replacements of the startmenu. Get it! <br /><br /><br />, February 20, 2010, 5:46:02 | Hi, this seems great. The only problem for me is that I like the Windows XP style menu. I like the &quot;pop out&quot; style menu, but not neccarsarily the &quot;classic&quot; view? Is there any way to get the &quot;pop out&quot; menu but keep the Windows 7 view/look? <br /><br /><br />, February 20, 2010, 2:42:30 | Zoran ZorkicGreat stuff! The guy fixed what Ms has broken! Life is good again! <br /><br /><br />, February 18, 2010, 7:59:10 | U. NesshoeverJust what I needed, to work as efficient with the keyboard as under any previous Windows version. THANK YOU!!! Finding this made my day! <br /><br /><br />, February 17, 2010, 3:34:15 | Just what I've been looking for and it's free. I tried 4 different tools, none of them had the right effect. I even deleted Windows 7, until I found this tool, reinstalled Windows 7 installed this program and now I'm a Happy Windows 7 user. Keep up the good work!!! <br /><br /><br />, February 17, 2010, 12:02:57 | Essential for advanced users <br /><br /><br />, February 16, 2010, 2:45:53 | Win 7 is good, this makes it better and easier for a more mature (older) user. <br /><br /><br />, February 15, 2010, 2:04:54 | Great program ! <br /><br /><br />, February 15, 2010, 1:24:53 | Thank you! <br /><br /><br />, February 13, 2010, 6:47:29 | I finally found one that works! <br /><br /><br />, February 13, 2010, 5:36:54 | great! finally a fix to give us back the very useful info on the folder status bar that MS robbed us of from vista onward! <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 9:43:24 | Love it! Thanks so much. Its probably impossible but &quot;Disable auto arrange in folder windows&quot; would put this way over the top. Any chance of that? <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 9:31:35 | Thank-you , thank-you for this. It is exactly what I was looking for to replace the chaotic mess that is the Windows 7 Start button (or whatever MS have renamed it). MS version tricky to navigate, confusing combination of functions, very poor customization options. To me Start should be easy, left-hand side contains programs, right-hand contains the libraries you have configured. The programs could be grouped in any way meaningful to the user e.g. &quot;Office&quot; &quot;Multimedia&quot; as containers for links to progs. Same idea for the right-hand side link to folders grouped (via libraries) in anyway meaningful to user. Retain &quot;All progs&quot; at bottom LHS, Retain option to launch Explorer at bottom RHS. W7 search is unreliable for content search. I use Google desktop. Rant over. <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 7:18:48 | great tool, works fine and it looks what it should, like windows Vista or XP system thanks 4 developing and 4 free download <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 6:23:18 | охуенная прога! пусть горит в аду тот мудак, который додумался убрать из &quot;семерки&quot; классическое меню &quot;пуск&quot; <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 10:53:21 | This is just great. I am so glad to have the + back in explorer and not that stupid triangle. Thanks <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 5:20:12 | Great! <br /><br /><br />, February 12, 2010, 12:45:02 | Thanks a lot - works like a charm; even with my 'old' shortcuts from Vista <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><br />, February 11, 2010, 4:21:09 | Great Job! Makes Windows 7 a lot more easier experience! Best of both worlds; I have the old UI, but improved security and updates. <br /><br /><br />, February 08, 2010, 11:27:50 | works perfect <br /><br /><br />, February 04, 2010, 12:37:43 | I just have it for 5 minutes on my system but I’m already amazed how easy it can be Another step closer to my XP style. Forget about CSMenu and the other one this has till now the most features and the best of it: It is for free. Great work and keep it up. Thx. <br /><br /><br />, February 04, 2010, 8:10:15 | if it ain't broke...don't fix it nothing really wrong with XP intreface <br /><br /><br />, February 03, 2010, 6:48:21 | Best Tool to get the old Start menu back <br /><br /><br />, February 02, 2010, 4:13:01 | LafinJackThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! <br /><br /><br />, January 31, 2010, 11:25:25 | Don AdamsWorks the way it's supposed to. Almost forgot what Xp start menu looked like. <br /><br /><br />, January 31, 2010, 1:47:31 | I am saved! Ever since I saw Win7 RC1, I had assumed that the Start menu functionality was broken and would be fixed in the final version. But when I saw that it was still there, it dawned on me that they meant it to be that way. Even worse, I realized that they had actually paid people to do that. How awful can you get? The Start menu was the one thing in 10 years of Windows development that had worked right. Now I can rest in peace. <br /><br /><br />, January 30, 2010, 2:56:31 | Лучшее меню для Пуск из того, что я видел и пробовал. Спасибо! <br /><br /><br />, January 30, 2010, 2:42:58 | Xia Zheng Xinso funny the project is ! <br /><br /><br />, January 28, 2010, 8:54:56 | SuniiThis is the best program I have installed since switching to Windows 7. It adds back useful features to explorer that Microsoft removed for no good reason. Highly recommended! <br /><br /><br />, January 27, 2010, 7:00:02 | I like it. A stunning piece of software! Go ahead, Win7 offers a lot of opportunities to do so. <br /><br /><br />, January 25, 2010, 9:35:33 | God this application RULES. Never would I have thought I'd be shedding tears of joy to simply have the functionality of the old Start Menu back, but this one does it perfectly. Seriously, ibeltchev, if you're responsible for creating this, I am forever indebted. Thank you!! <br /><br /><br />, January 25, 2010, 5:19:13 | Something that actually works. For those that like the classic Start Menu this is great. Unfortunately I like the new Start Menu except for the lack of an open when hover in the All Programs section. Being able to use the new Start menu with that feature would make a usable menu system with the eye candy intact. One thing I would change is to use a different name or to use different keywords when submitting to search engines. It was difficult to find where programs like CSMENU came up in many of the reviews when searching for Windows 7 &quot;Start Menu&quot;. Since I use a good dual pane file manager rather than the one built in to Windows the Classic Explorer part was not as important, but my wife disagrees as she hates the pop up's when copying, and I agree that this program improves MS's interface dramatically. Thank you for a well thought out and implemented program. For anyone who wants the classic start menu back in Windows 7 this program works better than the others. On the other hand can I beg for you to see about writing a program to modify how the standard Start Menu works? Adding a &quot;open when hover&quot; feature to the Windows 7 Start Menu so that the categories worked like the libraries do would make that menu system almost as quick as this one and for those of us who like eye candy a better choice. <br /><br /><br />, January 25, 2010, 2:55:02 | Thank you! I'm left-handed; customized mouse menus in Opera let me keep my right hand by the keyboard arrows and my left hand on the mouse. This creates a fast, rhythmic, work flow, and now I usually only lift my hands when I'm writing. Typing commands into Windows slows computing down, for me. So I've tried every Windows 7 patch I found, but yours is the only one I'll use! (I'd like to be able to change the selection highlight background color to match my desktop, though...) You have my gratitude, admiration &amp; best wishes (for what they're worth)! <br /><br /><br />, January 21, 2010, 2:53:16 | FranzCongratulations. That was *the* mandatory feature that was missing for me before migrating to Windows 7. Thank you. <br /><br /><br />, January 21, 2010, 1:13:14 | Wonderful. Gives me the missing features I used SO MUCH in XP that are missing from Window 7. <br /><br /><br />, January 21, 2010, 12:49:00 | willydvFantastic tool ! <br /><br /><br />, January 19, 2010, 5:49:48 | This is definitively the best Classic Starmenu App for Windows 7 - a must have!!! 100%!!! <br /><br /><br />, January 19, 2010, 5:26:42 | Awesome little tool. I always hated the new start menu, the explorer tree style and of course the confusing copy menu in Windows 7. Now it looks like my beloved old XP <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><br />, January 18, 2010, 5:52:36 | Lupin III.Up to now definitely the best &quot;classic&quot; startmenu! Also like the detailed documentation. Shows that the program is thoroughly developed! <br /><br /><br />, January 18, 2010, 3:40:33 | Thank you, Thank you. I just discovered your project and love it. Thank you again for being innovative when Microsoft was forcing its classic UI users to use the &quot;NEW&quot; but not necessarily better interface. Code jockeys like you have made a lot of people happy. <br /><br /><br />, January 17, 2010, 3:04:31 | DaveExcellent Project - SUGGESTION: One thing that was better in Win7 start menu, and is gone now with this Classic Shell, is a direct option to ShutDown/Restart/Switch User. Now we have to go through the (unnecessary) dialog with the options, while in Win7 we could Restart with 1 single click. Perhaps this could be a feature request ? <br /><br /><br />, January 17, 2010, 5:17:59 | Matthew MonroeClassic Shell is awesome!! I couldn't stand not seeing the total size of selected files in the status bar in Windows 7 Explorer; with Classic Shell -- I now know immediately the total size of selected files. The Classic Start Menu is also great to have again. Thank you ibeltchev for developing and publicly sharing this software!! The Microsoft developers are complete idiots for dumbing down the Windows 7 status bar. <br /><br /><br />, January 17, 2010, 2:26:38 | its working <br /><br /><br />, January 15, 2010, 3:36:54 | Awesome ) <br /><br /><br />, January 14, 2010, 7:40:46 | W. WhiteClassic Shell! Classic Shell! Classic Shell! :dances around in mad circles: Classic Shell! Classic Shell! Classic Shell! <br /><br /><br />, January 14, 2010, 6:14:09 | The classic Start menu is just awesome but Explorer navigation buttons are not that good looking as of Windows XP. <br /><br /><br />, January 11, 2010, 11:30:14 | Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! Please add option to disable auto arrange in explorer, I have an idea: all folders could be treated as desktop folder, then we`ll get native option to disable auto arrange. But I don`t know how to realize it, please help. <br /><br /><br />, January 10, 2010, 8:37:31 | r_xDifference to the default Win7 start menu: Less klicks, easier to configure and no more switching between mouse and keyboard. Great! <br /><br /><br />, January 10, 2010, 1:02:35 | THANK YOU, I LOVE YOU, the only problem remain: disable auto arrange <br />, January 09, 2010, 9:12:36 | Up to now definitely the best &quot;classic&quot; startmenu! Also like the detailed documentation. Shows that the program is thoroughly developed! <br /><br /><br />, January 09, 2010, 8:14:30 | Great Job. I like it very much. Thanks a lot. <br /><br /><br />, January 09, 2010, 1:07:55 | All the features mysteriously removed from Explorer... like file sizes once u select more than 16 files... <br /><br /><br />, January 07, 2010, 11:13:22 | Great replacement for the claustrofobics Vista/Win 7 start menu. It would be fine if they implement completelly the XP start menu look. <br /><br /><br />, January 06, 2010, 11:13:32 | I can't believe it! You folks made Windows 7 usable again. I was going to return to XP because of this space nonsense.. I love you guys! [donating] <br /><br /><br />, January 06, 2010, 5:26:15 | I found Classic Shell a few days ago after lots of grief about the Win7 UI (switching from WinXP), and apart from the good old cascading start menu, I really started to hate Windows Explorer. Thanks so much for bringing back all those useful features that have been removed by Microsoft in the past! Finally, I can use my computer as fast and effective as I could before. <br /><br /><br />, January 06, 2010, 4:29:48 | Saved me from Win7's &quot;improved&quot; star menu. <br /><br /><br />, January 05, 2010, 8:13:12 | Awesome! Finally I'm no longer encumbered by the stupid &quot;you have to use it because we think its good for you&quot; MS UI <br /><br /><br />, January 05, 2010, 6:07:23 | Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!! I'd be happy to make a donation. It is truly sickening that MS is so mentally deficient that you had to spend time fixing their design flaws. One thing that would be nice is to have an option for the search field on the classic menu - but just not in the default position. I'd have no problem with the Win7 search field if there was a way for me to move it to a different position so that it would not steal my keystrokes that I want to use for navigating the start menu subfolders. Now can you code up a way to disable the Ribbon menu on apps that are cursed with it? <br /><br /><br />, January 05, 2010, 5:16:20 | Great lightweight windows tweak -- no background task! <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> The up button in windows explorer is also great to have back. <br /><br /><br />, January 04, 2010, 4:05:50 | Absolutely what I was looking for. Further improvements are looked forward to, but this product is already head-and-shoulders above the competition (including the pricey for-pay competitor &quot;Seven Classic Start&quot;, which I purchased and briefly ran). Please keep up the amazing work! I am an IT administrator of several networks and am very particular about my own user interface and that of the servers whereon I operate — this is such a blessing of a piece of software. Thank you! <br /><br /><br />, January 03, 2010, 6:17:48 | It works great!!! But I need more customization <br /><br /><br />, January 02, 2010, 3:52:15 | Would it be possible to have a little bit more Aero style WITH keeping small icons in the main menu? Unfortunately I've lost the option to have small icons AND the highlighting based on Aero theme. <br /><br /><br />, January 02, 2010, 11:15:48 | This rules. MS screwed up by removing the classic shell functionality in the otherwise brilliant 7 - this brings it back! How do we donate? <br /><br /><br />, January 02, 2010, 6:04:08 | KevinThank you for this, now win 7 works for me <br /><br /><br />, January 01, 2010, 6:15:12 | Completely cured my only irritation with Windows 7. Thank you. <br /><br /><br />, January 01, 2010, 4:25:12 | Great, Thanks. Please add an option to Disable &quot;Auto Arrange of files/folders in Explorer Window&quot; <br /><br /><br />, January 01, 2010, 3:18:36 | Excellent!! <br /><br /><br />, January 01, 2010, 9:09:55 | Haki FaileyFantastic, It will replace all start menus of our PC's and servers. Great job. <br /><br /><br />, December 29, 2009, 10:52:45 | Вот это я долго искал, спасибо, крутой проект! <br /><br /><br />, December 29, 2009, 10:25:20 | AlexOMG Thank u! <br /><br /><br />, December 28, 2009, 1:20:50 | Love it. Can you find an Ability to disable folder auto arrange . <br /><br /><br />, December 27, 2009, 3:21:50 | mssThis is just great! Two things though.. With xp powertoys/tweak ui/registry change, I was able to change the <br />folder expansion delay in xp.. I would prefer to be able to set it to zero if I like that. Also it would be nice if the fade was optional because even if I have fade disabled in the rest of the windows 7 ui the classic start menu keeps fading when it opens. Again... this is just what I needed, thanx! <br /><br /><br />, December 26, 2009, 11:24:40 | Very Good Work ! Runs fine and is language localized! <br /><br /><br />, December 26, 2009, 9:20:42 | goood <br /><br /><br />, December 26, 2009, 2:31:31 | VeteranGreat!! Love this!!

I was looking for something like this for some and now I have it. Everyone should try it! Thanks a lot! Now, I just need to fix the auto roll in list view when I want to click in a file in the last right column and explorer will become a good tool again! <br /><br /><br />, December 24, 2009, 3:56:09 | The best project for Windows 7 ever! <br /><br /><br />, December 24, 2009, 3:41:46 | thank you, cool! <br /><br /><br />, December 24, 2009, 3:27:52 | Long awaited! Meets a frequent need - thank you indeed! Might be worth adding to the instructions about &quot;View Classix Explorer bar&quot; that the Status Bar needs to be turned on, too. I've had it turned off under Win 7 since it didn't add any useful information. Now, it does. <br /><br /><br />, December 21, 2009, 8:27:18 | Just wonderful. Thanks so much. <br /><br /><br />, December 17, 2009, 5:06:04 | Forša programma! Visiem iesaku! <br /><br /><br />, December 16, 2009, 4:08:33 | I'd absolutely recommend this app. Since moving to Win7 I've been through so many alternatives to Explorer looking for one that doesn't look like the rubbish MS has foisted on us. I had decided on XYPlorer (and still use it thanks to the many powerful extra features it has) but this little app has brought me back to using Explorer regularly. Amazing. And the Classic Menu is really great (though I would prefer to see it invoked by the &quot;all programs&quot; button rather than hijack the whole Start menu) and is *much more stable* than some alternatives I've tested -- no flickering or Aero issues! Again, amazing stuff, well done! <br /><br /><br />, December 10, 2009, 11:34:12 | Bug? If I add further folders in start menu's root, I cannot drag'n'drop items in these folders. Within programs folder and its subfolders everything works as intended. <br /><br /><br />, December 10, 2009, 7:14:12 | at long last a proper classic start menu that actually works. Brilliant! I would have liked to see a donation facility for the author. <br /><br /><br />, December 10, 2009, 10:38:18 | SpennyGreat work on implementation. Been missing the Up button for a looong time. And thanks for giving the option of Big Icons! Please keep up the fine work. <br /><br /><br />, December 09, 2009, 2:58:07 | Very accurate implementation of the Classic Start Menu for Win7. Excellent programming work, I love it. <br /><br /><br />, December 08, 2009, 4:26:54 | Awesome!!Awesome!!Awesome!! Love this idea!! Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please add feature: &quot;Disable auto arrange in folder windows&quot; <br /><br /><br />, December 07, 2009, 6:51:38 | OiToSIf you use Vista or Seven and you miss the great Windows XP Explorer toolbar with its buttons, you're gonna like this extension!
