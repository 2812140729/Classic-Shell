		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Perhaps it's not possible to achieve what I want with Classic Shell, but this is what I'm trying to do.<br /><br />Here's what my Explorer looks like now: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://imgur.com/Zosh3gZ">http://imgur.com/Zosh3gZ</a><!-- m --> <br /><br /><br />What I'm trying to do is the following: <br /><br />1) The first bar at the top, all I want is the icon of the program/folder in the top left, the folder name in writing just after it, and then of course minimize, maximize, and x at the right side. I DON'T need the paper with the check-mark, the pin, the upside down eject button, and then (in this instance) drive tools and then E:\. But if you've selected a photo for example, it'll say photo tools or what have you. All of that superfluous at best.<br /><br />2) I want the standard File, Edit, View, Help, etc. menu, with just text drop-down menu. Not this... I don't even know what this is. It's an abomination that's what it is. I don't want it. <br /><br />3) And then of course I have extra back, forward, and up buttons just in front of the address bar. Don't want those 3 icons there. <br /><br />4) And finally, want bigger icons from Back to Properties as I have it there, with text underneath each icon. <br /><br />I've fiddled with Classic Shell for an hour now, I don't actually think it's possible with the latest version to achieve what I want. But if so, any help would be most appreciated.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Someone made a ribbon disabler for Windows 8. It didn't work correctly with Windows 10 though, it was broken. I don't know if this is still the case however. I think there is an address bar remover program that annix made. I think this gets rid of the extra back, forward, and up buttons, but it does get rid of the address bar in the process. If Ivo made it possible to have the address bar as a toolbar like the current classic explorer is, then that'd be awesome, and would solve having extra up , back and forward buttons. I don't know if it's possible though. I only know that disabling it currently is possible.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm a mess. <br /><br />Not sure if you read my posts (that are now deleted), Ivo edited his comment but he initially had two fixes up, both with similar names. <br /><br />The point is, I have already downloaded and applied Ribbon Disabler. I still have the extra back, forward, up buttons. Not a HUGE deal. But if anyone comes up with a fix to remove that, or, the whole bar all together, that would be fantastic.  I use the address bar once in a blue moon, but, it's not a necessity, I can easily just open another Explorer in the off chance I need to.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Don't try to remove the Back, Forward and Up buttons from Explorer's address bar, they can't without patching which will make Explorer unstable.<br /><br />If you don't want two of them, you can easily remove them from the Classic Explorer toolbar. Start &quot;Classic Explorer Settings&quot; from the Start Menu -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Classic Shell. Check &quot;Show all settings&quot; and go to Toolbar Buttons tab. Right click the buttons you don't want in the left column and click OK.
