OK. As you wish. However I don't think you will find another high-quality free app like this. It had to be made closed source freeware because the internet is full of people who don't respect copyright, trademark or license or anything for that matter. They just want to cash in on something already successful and make a quick buck.<br /><br />As Ivo said, there were multiple different &quot;Classic Shell&quot; installers, almost all of them hardly different from the original but commercial. Some others were bundling adware/crapware along with the installer! People complained after installing the wrong &quot;Classic Shell&quot; from elsewhere for bundling unwantedware with it. So being open source was also harming the original's reputation.<br /><br />Besides, the Start Menu skins and graphical assets were always copyrighted even in the open source version, yet they were being distributed.<br /><br />I don't see why this would be a reason to stop using it. Windows itself, isn't open source or anything. So you trust Microsoft enough to use their closed sourced OS despite how they treat customers and don't trust the closed source Classic Shell which is given away for free to help people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Wed Jul 23, 2014 6:52 am</p><hr />

Hello,<br /><br />I understand your frustration regarding those things.<br /><br />But please also understand my frustration.<br /><br />One of the things that I always liked about Classic Shell was, that it was open source software. I wouldn't have used it if it was not.<br /><br />Now it is closed source, which is why I already have uninstalled it.<br /><br />By the way: I really don't like that you did not mention this change in the Classic Shell changelog/history:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/history/">http://www.classicshell.net/history/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Nowhere there do I see a mention that Classic Shell became closed source starting with version 3.9.0.<br /><br />Why not?<br /><br />As a long time Classic Shell user, I thought 3.9.x/4.x.x still would be open source and I only became aware of it being closed source just recently and just &quot;by accident&quot;, by reading the <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/faq/#general_oss" class="postlink">FAQ</a>.<br /><br />I regularly read the changelog/history, but it was never mentioned in there.<br /><br />It really should be in there IMHO.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Ivo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Also, if a place only allows open-source software then they can't use Windows anyway, which means Classic Shell is not going to be an issue <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /></div><br />I understand where your argument is coming from. But, then let me rephrase the sentence:<br /><br />It also would be sad not being able to use Classic Shell any longer because the place you want to use it at only allows using third-party applications (i.e. applications that are not installed already/by default) which are open source.<br /><br />Regards<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3014">xq901236</a> — Wed Jul 23, 2014 6:13 am</p><hr />

Where did you see it?<br /><br />I also doubt someone would buy it if they could get it for free. So I kinda ask myself how much of an issue that really is or would be.<br /><br />It would be much appreciated if you could release Classic Shell as open source software again.<br /><br />Regards<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3014">xq901236</a> — Tue Jul 22, 2014 10:09 am</p><hr />
