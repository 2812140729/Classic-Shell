It’s definitively not possible anymore to bring the analog clock back with the registry-record, which »grisha22« has posted, and »Gaurav« has linked the right information about it, why.<br /><br />Could this issue not be a typical task for the Classic Shell Menu developers? The possibility, to change the colour of the taskbar since Version 4.3.0, was great, now the return of the good old tray calendar from Win 7 could be a next goal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />On the topic of classic clocks, perhaps the clock can be a added extenion of the taskbar done in a similar way as the classic start menu program does [basically instead of replacing it with the windows 7 style clock, simply have it run 'over' it [or however it is that classic shell start menu works]. Basically it would probably be called 'classic clock' or 'classic time/date' and would have similar theme-ability as what the start menu and/or taskbar currently have in classic shell. Not sure how it would be coded but it might be a possible solution.<br /><br /><br />And as for my request, this one is more towards the forums than the actual program.. I was wondering what your guys' thought would be towards possibly adding a reputation system to the forum [possibly via a like/dislike system or something like that]. I've noticed a lot of the forums I've seen use them but this one doesn't seem to have one. Any thoughts on possibly looking into adding something like that to the Classic Shell forums?
