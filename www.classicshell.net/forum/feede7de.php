My point was that since Classic Shell was uninstalled, it can't possibly be that its functionality to skip to desktop or disable the hot corners is running. It is obviously gone from your machine, judging by the crash dump. So the fact that Classic Shell has features like &quot;skip metro&quot; or &quot;disable hot corners&quot; is irrelevant.<br /><br />The problem must be caused by some software messing up your system. This doesn't exclude Classic Shell, but makes any other software equally suspect. In fact, software that launches automatically on startup is even more suspect than software that is already uninstalled.<br /><br />I would look closely at the list of processes right after startup. See if temporarily disabling some of them fixes your problem. Also good idea to try safe mode.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Mon Feb 25, 2013 12:29 pm</p><hr />

No doubt that win8 pro upgrade or live or office could theoretically cause this.  I don't think video games or fraps or ventrilo could.  <br /><br />I'm just saying that I can 100% guarantee that no other program that advertises as being able to bypass Windows 8 Metro / turn off hot corners could have caused this due to my timeline.  Bottom line is that this software started the bypass of these features which has never been able to be undone and a second person has come to the forums with this issue now.<br /><br />Understandably you might not be able to solve this problem for me, but I'd ask that you not shoot the messenger but keep your eye open because SOMETHING is causing this problem and as development progresses you might spot the issue and be able to take corrective action.  Although, I was hoping that my particular issue would be solved, at this point I'm at a complete loss because I've tried everything I know of short of a fresh install (which is what the last guy did).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=361">alcuin</a> — Mon Feb 25, 2013 12:20 pm</p><hr />

I installed brand new Win8 on a 64-bit virtual machine, installed Classic Shell, then upgraded to Pro. It works just fine.<br />Tried it again with different Classic Shell options and still worked fine.<br /><br />I'm starting to doubt your claim that &quot;I can 100% guarantee that it's no other program causing it as well&quot;. Especially since you said that you upgraded to Pro, and also installed other software like Live and Office.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Sun Feb 24, 2013 5:26 pm</p><hr />

RPEnabled was only in the early betas in 2011. It is not relevant anymore.<br />I will see if I can find a non-pro version and try to recreate the upgrade scenario. Not sure how long it will take me to do that though.<br />In the meantime, see if you can disable all startup programs and non-essential services. You can also try rebooting in safe mode. It starts less processes that way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Sun Feb 24, 2013 10:34 am</p><hr />

There's definitely other odd behaviors that's existing because of this problem.  It was difficult to realize they were odd behaviors, because I'm not as familiar with Windows 8.  For instance, one thing I know is happening is that for instance in the MAPS app... if I move the mouse to the TOP of the screen it should change to a hand and let me move it from not being in full screen mode.  This should also let me drag it to the secondary monitor and then have my apps appear in the secondary monitor.  This doesn't work.<br /><br />Like I said, I can get the hot corners to temporarily work until restart by fiddling around with my dual monitor setup but this goes away when I restart the computer... it's as if something is in startup that is doing this, but I have tested by disabling everything in &quot;startup&quot; and also manually checking both the common startup folder and the user specific startup folder. Neither of which have anything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=361">alcuin</a> — Sun Feb 24, 2013 10:28 am</p><hr />

The whole reason being I never installed any other metro bypasser as the culprit is because this was the first software listed in the CNET article, and it did everything I needed at the time.  I never installed an alternate until AFTER I had already ran into this problem and I only installed alternates after uninstalling this one.  That was basically a test to see if I could get win 8 functionality back using an alternate.  It did not work.<br /><br />I then uninstalled the alternate and currently I have this one installed as I like it but hope to be able to toggle the Windows 8 settings when necessary.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=361">alcuin</a> — Sun Feb 24, 2013 10:24 am</p><hr />

The charm bar only works if I press Win+C not from hot corners.  I think that the start screen may be coming up briefly, but it's hard to tell because it is very fast... yes I'm certain I've seen it briefly drawing on the screen before going away.  Logging off and back on does not fix it.  There has been no other software that I have added that edits the registry in any way.  I've installed one game video editing software and a voip.  No other software should've affected windows in this way.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=361">alcuin</a> — Sun Feb 24, 2013 9:44 am</p><hr />

When you say &quot;charm bar doesn't work&quot;, does it not work at all, or only with the mouse? If you press Win+C do you get the charms? If you press the Win key do you still see the Metro screen?<br /><br />When the Metro screen is skipped after login, is it immediate or after few seconds? Also, if you log off and log in, is the Metro screen still skipped?<br /><br />I installed all the latest updates for my 64-bit Windows 8 and I still can't reproduce the problem. All of the Classic Shell settings work as designed. I can skip or not the Metro screen, and I can enable or disable the corners.<br /><br />Looks like in your case some permanent change was done to your system. Classic Shell doesn't do that (at least not on purpose). It is not a corrupted system file because sfc should have caught it. That leaves the registry. It can't be the user registry (HKCU) because a new user has the same problem. That leaves the system registry (HKLM). Do you recall using a registry cleaner or similar software that can do permanent changes in the system registry?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Sat Feb 23, 2013 9:58 am</p><hr />

I've noticed some very odd behavior from playing around a bit.<br /><br />If I go in and set my monitors to only display on 1 monitor and turn off the other monitor completely and then sign out and sign back in I can get a brief (one time use only) moment where my charm bar will activate using the hot corner.  It will still continue to skip the metro screen on restart though.  After that the charm bar doesn't work anymore.<br /><br />If I then turn it back to dual monitor, I get the hot corners working until computer reset and the hot corners stop working again.  None of this addresses the skip metro ui problem.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, I decided to try to install some competitor start menu program (start8) to see if by maybe getting some alternative program in there to control the behaviors and then turning those settings off and back on if I could get a response from them instead to rectify the situation.  None of them will now take control of this problem using their settings.  It seems however Win8 got sucked into flubbing up the start screen and hot corners, it is very persistent and hard to reset.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=361">alcuin</a> — Fri Feb 22, 2013 3:46 pm</p><hr />
