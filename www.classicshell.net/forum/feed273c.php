We use it and love it here at ProDigital Software - a small software business.  Back when the sources were available I fully vetted the program.<br /><br />This is a product that's better implemented than Microsoft's own code.<br /><br />-Noel<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=552">NoelC</a> — Thu May 21, 2015 10:24 pm</p><hr />

Hello Everyone,<br />I was wanting to see if I could get the community's help to generate a list of companies that actually use classic shell. The reason being is our company is pretty strict about installing 3rd party applications, however part of one project we are working on is upgrading our 2008 R2 servers to 2012 servers. The problem is, several vendor's we work with are already having issues navigating through Windows 2012, and I have noticed most of them ask us to open up what they are looking for, as they are use to working with Windows 2008 R2 not the Metro screen. I have already contacted the people at Classic Shell and found that indeed the program only communicates for updates, which can be disabled, however I think if I got a list of companies that use it, that just maybe I'd have better luck convincing senior management that it is safe to use, so if anyone uses it in a company environment please post the company name so I can create a list to share with our senior management.<br /><br />Thanks!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10295">Michael_34</a> — Tue May 19, 2015 1:09 pm</p><hr />
