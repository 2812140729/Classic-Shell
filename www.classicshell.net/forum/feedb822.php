the internet is pure(mostly)... free-speech.. you're mad because someone chose to tell others that you were a spammer, those others chose to listen, by adding you (although not directly) to their ban-list. its their fault if they fell for the 'lie' or sacrificed some non-spammers to ban the true spammers more easily..<br /><br />If you want to say absolutely whatever you want, to whoever will listen, start your own website.., because although the internet itself is all about free speech, privately owned websites don't have to be.., in a sense what is tolerated on a board, reflects not just on the poster, but on the boards owner for allowing it to remain..<br /><br /><br />as for calling you a liar, i'm not, i'm simply stating i have no idea if you are telling the truth or not.. because i hardly know you either (although i still know you better than him)<br /><br />and yes i DID want to clean a few threads up, that went off on tangents not really related to classic shell..., because that is, and what this website should be about... but that was before i realized how strongly you felt against it...<br /><br /><br />As you suggested earlier, instead of deleting post, ill change their coloring/size to make them easier to discern/skip<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Thu Apr 11, 2013 6:38 am</p><hr />

its a bit like saying, all totalitarian dictators with absolute power aren't bad guys, isnt it...<br /><br />i didnt say all.. I'm sure you can find some likeable Communists or Fascists as well.. theyre not all bad guys... seriously..<br /><br />so, what you're saying is I'm a liar cause there is no proof?<br /><br />ya, I do think this conversation is over<br /><br />I've lived in a Communist country run by a Totalitarian Regime for a very, very long time.<br /><br />and there is exactly no difference in how they wield their power and how the vast majority of moderators wield theirs<br /><br />I mean, the internet has become the most oppressive, tyrannical, absolutely corrupt place on the face of the planet<br /><br />this kook, just like most every mod I've personally had experience with, is WAY worse than the world's strongest &amp; most oppressive Communist regimes...<br /><br />I dont really know how to explain it other than its born of holding power over others<br /><br />there's really no other explanation.<br /><br />you want to make your own little version of reality? just delete what was there, pretend it wasnt there, alter what remains, and then lie your little swanky butt off about really happened, regardless if everyone knows differently.<br /><br />that is modus operandi for practically every Oppressive Iron-Fist-Ruling, Mind-Controlling, Propaganda-Spreading Regime to have existed since Hitler.<br /><br />exactly, in every way, to what goes on in forums..<br /><br />I've spent most of my life being controlled &amp; manipulated, oppressed &amp; brainwashed.. I know exactly what it is, how it works, and what it feels like, and what kind of cretins are behind it..<br /><br />and I dont really care what your laws are or arent. i know whats what, and what becomes what, and what deserves what...<br /><br />and ya... it is Defamation... this is about the defamation, and abuse of power by mods..<br /><br />I am the last person on earth to give a crap about name calling, since I grew up when you could say anything you wanted to on the internet. anything at all.<br /><br />I'm all about the free speech <br /><br />I pointed out his potty mouth because his entire facade is dependent on his telling everyone else they are out of line and wont be responded to if they dont talk to him like he's anything but the little princess he thinks he is.<br /><br />and thats that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Thu Apr 11, 2013 1:59 am</p><hr />

well I'm not particularly in his defense.. I'm offering an alternative viewpoint.., i never once said he was a good mod/admin, simply that i haven't personally seen anything wrong with his website (not that its not there), other than the &quot;<span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">douche bag</span></span></span>&quot; remark. which you've mentioned worse in this thread about him. as you said i dont know the guy.. i just dont see your argument as objective, partially because all the emotion you have brought to the house; if you want to convince me, i need actual sources.. not just paraphrasing, because they are easily skewed.. <br /><br />however i do disagree with your sentiment that ALL moderators are bad guys, bla bla, and feel that the bad ones just stick out more..<br /><br />and @ anonymously; what internet are you on? the internet is far from anonymous  theres just little/no follow through.. because you know.. &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones.. but words can never hurt me&quot;; although i do wish you COULD be more anonymous. <br /><br /><blockquote class="editor"><blockquote class="editor"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="background-color:#a9b8c2;"><strong><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">[b]Quote:</strong></span>[/b]</span></span></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote class="editor"><blockquote class="editor"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#fafafa;"><span style="color:#4b5c77;">also defamation might be illegal here, but it isn&#39;t HIGHLY illegal.. its definitely not in the same category as rape, and murder... <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif&quot;%20alt=&quot;:P&quot;%20title=&quot;Razz&quot;%20style=&quot;margin:%200px;%20padding:%200px;%20border:%20none;" alt="" /></span></span></span></blockquote></blockquote><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">its a Proper &amp; Legal response to something that should/could/might/probably would get someone hurt/injured/beaten/battered/hospitalized or worse</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">I&#39;m all grown up.. thats what grown ups do.. when I was younger, I&#39;d definitely think the other options were a whole lot better.. &quot;</span></span></span><br /><br />Im lost here.., all i stated is name calling doesn't fall into the same category as assault, rape, or murder..., not that it wasnt still against the law.

I can tell you right now a list of about 8 or 12 moderators who would love to have put me on that list because they personally hate me and have a personal vendetta against me..<br /><br />I'm going to guess the one who blacklisted me goes by the name &quot;Andrew Noseworthy&quot; and moderates &quot;Gzstuff&quot;? I almost knocked that kids head in in the real world.. I know him actually.. he's more afraid of me than anyone on earth.. and would love nothing more than to do something exactly like this..<br /><br />as would several other VERY corrupt mods in certain gaming forums.. and one media forum<br /><br />I'd appreciate it if you could tell me which one.<br /><br />I dont hold you personally accountable, I hold them accountable.. so long as I'm not on your site for something i havent done, I have no problem with you or your site.. but i would hope that other people are not being similarly abused by corrupt moderators through your site, and you should hope so to! and you need to make it so that cant happen, or your site will fail eventually<br /><br />so please give me the information, I will contact them myself and get to the bottom of this<br /><br />thanks for removing my name from your site.

why would he have been directed to your site in the first place, if his email wasn't on the list. i read on one of the pages, i think the ban appeal page, that some other site, was redirecting, or maybe expanding your list on their own? so he's basically complaining over something you have no power over, on that site?<br /><br /><br />Although he may seem like a 'douch bag' (not that there's any need for you to escalate things by calling him that) to you, and this particular thread isn't a good example for his usual personality.. (at least from my past experiences, he seems helpful and nice)<br />when someone gets heated there personality can change quickly. which is likely the case given his previous experience with moderators.. I think,he has a great deal of censorship in his own country, with 'the great firewall of china' and all.. (apologies if this is off, i'm not an expert on the subject)<br />and once someones on the offensive.. its not hard to want to go defensive, and take a hard stance against them, regardless of what is right or wrong.<br /><br />if your website is designed to only stop spammers, and not people with 'hot tempers' you should try to accommodate people with hot tempers, because in their situation it is a reasonable response, even if it isn't the correct one. Although it can be hard to give a whiner what they want, sometimes it is the right thing to do, regardless of personal opinion. Now if you had a specific section for 'livewires', or people you suspect to be easily riled up, that would be a different matter.. but it shouldn't be a category that is included by default when admins of website decide to use your list or not...<br /><br />Also even if he doesn't have legal grounds, he does have some moral grounds, and he has supposedly put a lot of work into earning a reputation around the web, on that email address... even if it isn't his personal name.. its still defamation of what he holds to be his identity.. as far as legality is concerned.. I'm not a lawyer so i wont pretend to be one... especially since you're most definitely more versed in the subject, having to deal with such threats, <br /><br /><br />somewhat offtopic: I believe ive read in some cases (of copyright infringement), that some courts have ruled an IP to be personally Identifiable, and thus part of their identity.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sat Apr 06, 2013 10:27 am</p><hr />

they suggest you be polite for your own sake. the people deciding whether to unban you are infact people to. and what would you do, if someone started screaming/yelling at you, then asked you to do them a favor.., i know personally id probably laugh, and ask them &quot;why should I&quot;. although yes there situation is a bit different, and they just may not understand your frustration.., someone once said your greatest tool is a smile, and in many cases i believe that to be true..<br /><br /><br />although maybe there showing different information to people blacklisted, or maybe if your reading a chinese version? i dont find anything ive read on that site to be all that outrageous or uncalled for...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sat Apr 06, 2013 5:53 am</p><hr />

what you dont read, is that if you mention anything to do with legal action at all, they will never remove your name from the list, ever..<br /><br />which is just a ploy to try to keep themselves in the business of being jokers<br /><br />and note how the very first thing they do is INSIST on you being polite.. because apparently if they feel your request does anything but verbally caress their entire being, they will never ever remove your email address either<br /><br />I doubt anyones ever talked to them politely..<br /><br />thats like the police pulling you over, slamming your head into the curb, hauling you off to jail, and then leaving you in prison for life if the first thing you said to them was anything other than &quot;thankyou sir&quot;<br /><br />the entire site reeks of saucy cheekiness <br /><br />and then it vaguely states they will review it &amp; if they think its been entered &quot;Fairly&quot; then you will never receive a reply either and also never be removed<br /><br />so already they have 3 or 4 reasons to never ever reply to you and never remove your email.. ever.. and you have no idea for what or which one..<br /><br />and they dont even bother telling you what they think constitutes &quot;Fairly&quot; and for what offenses your email has been banned<br /><br />again, its 100% non-transparent, and offers no outlet for anyone other than members of the Berlin Boys Choir to receive answers to any inquiries<br /><br />there is alot of hoo-haa on that site and not a single piece of relevant information.. there is a clinical term for not caring about anyone other than yourself and believing you are in some sort of perma-god-mode &amp; other such ludicrous behavior.. its called &quot;megalomania&quot;..<br /><br />and i'm not entertaining their disorder<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Sat Apr 06, 2013 2:38 am</p><hr />

checked faq, saw this :<blockquote class="editor"><br /><h3>I&#39;m listed on your site but Im not a spammer</h3><br /><h3>Firstly, its not an accusation of anything. A lot of the information that is listed is gathered from &quot;honeypots&quot; setup to trap spammers. Being listed on the site doesnt mean you have been sending spam. The IP address that you have, mightve been inherited from someone that spammed, someone may have just used your email address or even that you have downloaded a virus or trojan. If you use the <a href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/removal" class="postlink">removal</a> page and be polite, then we can figure out what has happened and get it fixed.&quot;</h3><br /></blockquote><br /><h3></h3><br /><br /><br />to me that seems fairly polite, and decent of a request; i clicked the removal, page, but since im not on the list, it said i wasnt on the list, and i cant see any other page.. unless i submit my own name to the forums..<br /><br />the homepage is a slightly offensive, in the fact that it singles out email addresses and such. but one possible reason is so when someone issues a ban, they can confirm it has been added successfully. Also clicking a random 10 emails, i see that 8/10 of them had over 10 email addresses banned..<br />although 1 of them had 3, and the other had 2.<br />This is a small sample, and some legit users with heated opinions are bound to slip through the cracks.. but overall, it seems atleast 80% of bans seem to be spammers.., yes though they could have a system that removes 1 email address from each IP every 30 days, because the spammers create like 10 emails a day, that number would be insignificant, and not worth the spammers time to re-use that email anyways..., and would remove any legit people from the list...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3><blockquote class="editor">[h3]</h3><h3></h3><br /><br /></blockquote>[/h3]<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sat Apr 06, 2013 12:32 am</p><hr />

i dont remember the exact words, you can go over there and look it up on their legal page<br /><br />the point is, it is set up to work like this:<br /><br /><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>It shows you are blacklisted from registering at all sites using stopforumspam.com, which they are using at the site you tried to register at, with a link to stopforumspam.com website</li><li>you go to the site, and it shows you a list of the most recent blacklisted email addresses, with an apparent degree of great pride, so mods can go there and gloat over seeing the people they've blacklisted.. if it was for actual spam, there would be no reason to hang out and show off the email addresses you are blacklisting, as they're all disposable &amp; meaningless anyway.. hence, right off the bat you are confronted by a site that is boasting of the emails they blacklist, yours included</li><li>You look around the site and you dont see any other reason for it being there but to tout email addresses, and you search harder and discover a way, through menu items, to eventually ask for a repeal</li><li>By this time you are foaming at the mouth at the wiseguy who would make such a retarded waste of space which seems to be very giddy about having blacklisted your email address which you've used proudly for 20 years, and is well known around the web</li><li>You find it to be nothing but slanderous, hazing, oppressive, underhanded, devious, and shrouded in hidden intent since nothing makes any sense on that site at all..</li><li>You know, then, by matter of deductive reasoning, that there must only be one use for this site, for people to destroy your online presence, out of spite, hateful grudges, vendettas, malevolence, and that you apparently have one or a group of creepy stalkers on the web who are actually moderators at some site you likely registered for for a day, posted an opposing view, and were immediately flamed, trolled, &amp; banned by the imbedded group of usual suspects / forum-mates.. </li><li>You look the site over high and low for a contact method, because at this point you dont want to appeal anything, you want to speak with the owner of the site and find out who exactly added your email to the list.. but there is no such email address to be found on the entire site.. for a site that touts banning email addresses, theirs is completely secret</li><li>You look to see what it takes to ban an email address, and so you click on &quot;submit an email address&quot;, and find it requires loads of personal information about the person being banned, that is likely never even to be found from actual spammers, and absolutely nothing from the submitter but any random APIkey</li><li>So you look for some sort of identity, any identity, of who may be behind the site.. and you find absolutely nothing.. 100% secret, hidden &amp; totaly anonymous.. as if it wasnt actually created by anyone</li><li>So you go back to that quasi-appeal option, which you already know is not really going to reach anyone worth talking to... and will probably end up in the basement of some unsuspecting mothers home who has worries about what her kid is doing down there all day, but doesnt have the heart to find out for sure... </li><li>So you tell that hidden-in-the-basement creepy little cretin exactly whats on your mind, still in disbelief as you're typing that such a site is even fathomable, and you tell him frankly, the site is slanderous &amp; nothing more than Defamatory, which is obviously illegal and nothing else, and you tell him to stop his little dorky illegal behavior and take your personal email address off of his retarded blacklist. the same as anyone would.. </li><li>Then you never receive any reply, ever.. then you go back looking for a way to hunt him down, and you by chance stumble across some obscure legal disclaimer at the back of the site that says if the request you sent him stated anything about any sort of legal problem, or legal issue, or stated any other sort of legal action, then your email address will never be removed and you will never be replied to</li><li>you are then left with no recourse...</li></ol><div align="right">-</div>its is SOOOOOO the typical moderator.. <br /><br /><br />its nothing but a big old troll.. a typical forum trap set up by mods and their cronies ... you find such little traps all over the internet, that are for no other reason than to ban users from their site, and to try and let them continue imagining they have something useful to offer the world, and are somehow in control of the entire internet.. which obviously has a few holes in it, and so they created this site where they can carry over their delinquencies into other domains and haze &amp; degrade &amp; defame you to their teeny tiny whits last end <br /><br />you know, Law is there for a reason. there is no &quot;threat of a law&quot;. the law is the law.. and there needs to be a justice if theres a law or else the law is meaningless<br /><br />and laws are made to protect people.<br /><br />and its precisely because there are numerous cretins who thrive on the misery &amp; oppression &amp; abuse &amp; manipulation of others that there needs to be laws, because their actions are such that they need to be punished, and if not by a law, then by the hand of the oppressed.<br /><br />its for their own safety &amp; protection as well.. a Lawyer is what is called when the Plaintiff or the one who has been wronged believes the wrong-doer should be shot in the head, but the one who has been wronged is a law-biding citizen or doesnt particularly think the issue is really worth the bloodshed, or the offender really worth the bullet<br /><br />thats why we have lawyers.. and why need them.. a &quot;Threat of Legal Action&quot; is something criminals say when they are about to uprooted &amp; weeded out...<br /><br />that isnt a threat...<br /><br />Sending you a photo of you in the mall creeping people out with creepy little stares from across the way, together with a bullet and a little note saying &quot;remove my email and pay me $50,000, or just pay me $50,000 by noon tomorrow, or your mom will wonder why the basement no longer smells funny&quot; is a threat.. obviously<br /><br />But its one or the other..<br /><br />I chose the legal, correct, and proper way to deal with people such as this, causing problems such as this<br /><br />in an ideal world.. there wouldnt be this kind of people who do this kind of thing.. but, reality check.. thats the way the world is.. chock full of little cretinous creeps<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Fri Apr 05, 2013 11:51 pm</p><hr />

Ive seen people judged by IP before <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, especially when its the only thing to go on, but i personally try not to. Although statistically, alot of scams are run out of china or under-developed countries, because of enforcement of laws and such... <br /><br /><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">&quot;so, its set up to basically say, &quot;whoever replies to me asking to be lifted from my obviously hazingly illegal website, will never ever be removed from my list, thereby giving me a reason to keep your email banned forever&quot;</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="color:#323d4f;"><span style="font-family:Lucida Grande, Trebuchet MS, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="background-color:#ececec;">and once you&#39;ve sent that, it doesnt matter how many other emails you send or what they say, it says right there on the site in the fine print that he will never lift your email from the blacklist.. &quot;</span></span></span><br />to me this is is a little unclear.., the first bit is a paraphrasing correct?<br />because what kind of person admits there website is illegal, thats just asking for legal trouble.<br />and if they didn't want to accept ban appeals, why would they even accept any responses...<br />also theres probably a lot of push and shove in there line of work.. if someone screams at you, you usually scream back.. They possibly added that 'fine print' because they were tired of being harassed by banned members.<br /><br /><br />legal action is a threat, albeit within the law. saying or implying any action that the recipient believes to be a negative consequence, is infact a threat, whether it qualifies for counter-legal action is another matter...<br /><br />Ironically, i've been told by a cop (asked outa curiosity, not circumstance). that giving someone an ultimatum isn't threat. (unless that action isnt reasonably avoidable) IE &quot;Do that and ill kill you!!&quot;<br /><br />also you actually contacted a lawyer over this?, and you talk about holding a grudge <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Fri Apr 05, 2013 8:36 am</p><hr />

ya, that all sounds reasonable... and would work for a reasonable site <br /><br />i didnt event talk to anyone.. it says &quot;repeal&quot;.. and somewhere after your appeal on a page at the back of the site somewhere is their &quot;legality counter-measures&quot; page with the long list of everything they do to counter-act the slew of legal threats they get.. including at the bottom, a bit about &quot;im never ever going to reply to you if you say anything about legal action against me and your name will stay banned forever or until settled in a court of law&quot;<br /><br />it has nothing to do with spam, and everything to do with creating an environment where they can ban people across sites for nothing to do with spam, and everything to do with personal vendettas<br /><br />its a vindictive site<br /><br />anyone, finding themselves or their name on a black list which is trying to force itself into wide-spread acceptance where any moderator can add your private email you entrusted them with, in complete anonymity, and with complete support by that site, would likely default to some mention of defamation &amp; legal action.. were they to know the actions of that site to be criminal in nature<br /><br />legal action is not a threat... thats handling matters without resorting to threats. thats the legal &amp; proper way to handle matters.. otherwise, there's little left but actual threats.. anyway, you can spend your money on a lawfirm to take down what is likely just a fake spoof site anyway created as a means to further some doofy agenda &amp; allow a little grommet to punish people unfortunate enough to have come across his little site.. extending a punishment into other aspects of the users life beyond the cretins own domain.. or spend it on hiring an investigative PI firm to run down the online forensics and let you know who made it &amp; where he lives... if I was going to do one, I'd choose the latter.<br /><br />so, its set up to basically say, &quot;whoever replies to me asking to be lifted from my obviously hazingly illegal website, will never ever be removed from my list, thereby giving me a reason to keep your email banned forever&quot;<br /><br />and once you've sent that, it doesnt matter how many other emails you send or what they say, it says right there on the site in the fine print that he will never lift your email from the blacklist.. <br /><br />hence, its for the sole reason of banning people permanently.. its a sickly, disgusting, cowardly behavior, which is right in-line with the behavior of alot of mods i've come across in my 20 years of internet usage. <br /><br />and then he hides.. there is no email address given to contact anyone, no contact information, nothing which shows any sort of identity or accountability.. its all created for this one purpose and this one purpose alone.. and nothing to do with spammers...<br /><br />And I'll inform portableapps.com and any other website I come across using this service of exactly the type of people they are in bed with, but they'll likely have to stop using the service for me to be able to access their site<br /><br />but i did contact a lawyer, but for way cheaper I can hire a Private Investigative Service &amp; Online Forensics company to find out who he is &amp; where he is hiding... which would seem more fruitful. <br /><br />at any rate.. its just a joke, perpetuated by the same sort of mods you find in most forums.. thinking their clever, but theyre just clowns.. and they dont really even seem to care that theyre clowns..<br /><br />but whatever.. forget it<br /><br />and ya, I'm in China, but so are alot of Expatriates.. and there are countless Expatriates living all over the world from English-Speaking countries in Eastern Europe, Russia, Elsewhere in Europe, Central &amp; South America, West Asia, East Asia, SE Asia, &amp; all over Africa.. to judge someone based on IP alone is pretty silly.. since most of the people in these countries dont bother with English sites, at least not in any communicative fashion you can even understand..<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Fri Apr 05, 2013 7:34 am</p><hr />
