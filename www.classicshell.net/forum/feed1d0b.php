hello, I have this weird problem with the file explorer and desktop. I have a clean installation of win 10 pro on both my laptop and desktop pc and they both have the exact problem. heres the problem. the desktop icons no matter how many times I set it to small icons and auto arrange...it always revert back to medium icons and no auto arrange. in the file explorer...formally known as windows explorer, when I set the folder sort by date modified and ascending.....it always reverts back to sort by name and ascending. now....if I save all folders to sort by modified and ascending, every folder will be set to sort by date modify and ascending. now I have the opposite problem any folder that I now change to sort by name, always reverts back to sort by date modified. so in a nutshell...its all or none...I either have everything sorted by name or sorted by date modified. I have this problem on both pcs with clean installs. im not sure if its windows 10, something I did or classical shell doing this. I have an older version of classical shell on my win 7 drive and laptop and I do not have this problem. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />ive been pulling my hair out over this for a few days now and decided to post here to see if anyone knows whats going on.<br /><br /><br /><br />any help would be appreciated<br /><br /><br />thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11325">yikes</a> — Fri Sep 04, 2015 3:55 pm</p><hr />
