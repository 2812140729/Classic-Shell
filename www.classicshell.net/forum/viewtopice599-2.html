ROSA Image Writer is free and safe.</div><br /><br />Thanks for the information.  I'm up and running now, but this is good to know in general.

It seems that I have been infected with this virus.<br />I have read the posts in this thread and like squaredcircle84, I am not very experienced in PC maintenance.<br /><br />My first hurdle has been downloading the file ubcd535.iso and burning it to a USB flash drive using RosaImageWriter.<br /><br />I do this, but I Still boot to the spade logo, (even when selecting the flash drive as the boot device in the menu accessed at power up). On plugging the flash drive into another PC, it seems that the flash drive is not bootable. So where am I going wrong in this 'first simple step'?

You may have to do the deeper search option in testdisk.<br /><br />You may be able to start from your Windows disk, open cmd with shift+f10, type in notepad, click file&gt;open, and figure out which drive letter is your Windows installation. Close notepad and go back to the cmd. Type in &quot;bcdboot DRIVELETTER:\Windows /s DRIVELETTER: /f UEFI&quot; an example if your Windows drive happens to be conveniently at drive C in WinPE: &quot;bcdboot C:\Windows /s C: /f UEFI&quot; In my case I didn't have to use bcdboot since I was MBR/BIOS based but I did notice my Windows drive ended up on drive D instead of C. Check to make sure first. Unplug any drives that aren't affected.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I thank everyone that is wrote everything here, @danooct1, on /r/PCmasterrace and /r/Windows10, but unfortunately none of it has worked for me.  Below is step by step of what has happened to my machine in the last 72 hours.  <br /><br />Before I begin my setup is as follows.  Note, I'm currently operating on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.<br /><br />C:\ is my 250gb SSD for Windows and program files.<br />D:\ is my 500gb HDD for e v e r t h i n g else.  Music, movies, photos, videos, cell phone data back up, applications from winzip to Adobe Premiere, back files like favorites, invoices, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.  I do have an external back up... I think I last updated in February.  None the less I have crucial files to lose.<br /><br />1.  Install Windows 10 from the free the upgrade on my Windows 7 (I think premium) 64bit.  It's not an OEM, I have a key.  <br /><br />2.  I installed the infected version of Classic Shell.  Ran the setup and a small window appeared then disappeared almost immediately. <br /><br />3. I noticed the D drive missing from File Explorer.  I rebooted.  <br /><br />4.  I am greeted with a black screen with a white spade and a white blinking cursor next to each other in the bottom left corner. The machine freezes here and does not go any further.<br /><br />5.  I seek help on Reddit on /r/Windows 10.  I am told to make a recovery USB on an operational PC.  Did that.  Boot up, choose 64-bit installation.  <br /><br />6.  Get a message that says: it looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media period if you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from your PC and click yes. If you want to perform a clean installation instead, click No.  <br /><br />7a.  Clicking yes just reboots the machine and boots the USB Drive again.  Dead end.  <br /><br />7b.  So I click No.  <br /><br />8.  I'm greeted with the first Windows setup window.  it asks for Language to install, Time and currency, keyboard and input method.  Everything is fine.  Next.  <br /><br />9.  Second window gives me two options.  In the center is a big inviting button that says Install Now.  In the bottom left is the Repair Your Computer option.  I choose repair.    <br /><br />10.  In this screen I have 2 options.  1) Troubleshoot and 2) Turn Off your PC.  I choose troubleshoot.<br /><br />11.  In Troubleshoot, I have the following options: SYSTEM RESTORE, SYSTEM IMAGE RECOVERY, STARTUP REPAIR, COMMAND PROMPT, UEFI FIRMWARE SETTINGS, GO BACK TO PREVIOUS BUILD.  <br /><br />12.  I started with Start Up Repair first.  Click it.  I get this message &quot;Start Up Repair couldn't repair your PC.  Press advanced options to try other options to repair your PC or shut down to turn off your PC.  Advanced options just brings me back to step 10.  <br /><br />13.  I try System Restore, I get this message in a window with a white x in a red circle: to use system restore you must specify which Windows installation to restore. Restart this computer select an operating system and then select system restore.  I cannot do any of this.    <br /><br />14.  I try System Image Recovery.  I get a message that says this: windows cannot find a system image on this computer. Attach the backup hard disk or answer to the final DVD from a backup set and click retry. Alternatively close this dialogue for more options.<br /><br />14a.  I asked on Reddit but no one gave me a definitive answer; if it was possible for someone to give me an image file and then I could put it on an external HDD or USB key and then use it for this step?  But perhaps that's not possible or it shouldn't be necessary.  None the less, let's move on.  <br /><br />15.  I tried going back to previous build option.    It said: we ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build. Try resetting your current build instead.  <br /><br />16.  This is when I looked further and found the YouTube video by @danooct1.  <br /><br />17.  I did just what he said to do.  Went back to Startup Repair, but still getting the message in step 12.  <br /> <br />18.  I followed the link in the description to here.  Finally found people that were getting the spade and cursor, not the message that says the journey ends here.  CaffeinePizza was the first user that had my symptoms but they said their fix was for every Win OS but not 10.  So that doesn't help me.    <br /><br />19.  Back on Reddit someone suggested I try ##Windows on IRC and I was met with lukewarm reception at best.  I logged in, explained my issue, and received these two responses:. &quot;ew Classic Shell&quot;, and, &quot;Users in here don't respond well to third party apps&quot;.  I haven't been in an IRC chatroom since I thought I was a 1337 haxor back in the t50.com/astalavista.box.sk warez days, but being on my Note 3, I wasn't about to try and squeeze out any help on my puny 5 inch screen with these guys acting like that.<br /><br />So now I'm about to enter Doomsday Scenario unless someone can actually help me out here.<br /><br />20.  In command prompt, I tried to see if I could format my C drive and possibly start over.  The format instruction works but I didn't go through with it for obvious reasons.<br /><br />21.  I then went back to step 9 and tried that big inviting button that said Install Now.  I applied my Win 7 key and it works.  Now I saw something devastating but I only hope it's the virus at work and not the truth.  <br /><br />So in the installation process it prompts to choose drives to install on.  My C drive is unable to (unless I choose the format option it offers).  <br /><br />But then I saw something on my 500gb D drive.  It says 500gb capacity, 500gb free.  Before anything else, can someone tell me whether or not that's a true reading of my drive, or is that just the MBR being screwed up?  Because if it's a true reading I will have lost some crucial pieces of my life.<br /><br />Additionally, would it help if I installed a fresh install of Windows on an external drive, that way I could get in and fix this problem on a working OS, or is that unnecessary; I mean I'd prefer not to install on an external and fix the problem from here.  <br /><br />So, this is where I'm at.  I've given every piece of detail up to this point.  Man like... I really just want this fixed.  I'm not an idiot, I know to run a computer... Jeeze, someone call me and walk me through it if you know exactly what to do.<br /><br />Thanks for any help.

My only suggestion would be to find a Linux LiveCD or DOS diskette; something that can run testdisk and see if you can rewrite your partition table. If not, you can go warez and get hiren's bootcd. It should have some software in it that will let you can for &quot;deleted&quot; files on the drive and copy them off to another external hard drive or flash drive.

This tool is used to quickly safely remove Linux and its partitions, any, and resetthe MBR record. It may be possible to use just the reset MBR record and then even run the quick learning curve to see if any of the partition etc can be dealt with if existential via the infection (s). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>WATCH THIS SHORT HOW TO VIDEO TO SEE IT.... </strong></span><strong>  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6I6xv8BNoc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6I6xv8BNoc</a><!-- m --><br />  </strong><br /><br />I Live here on the net: HOME: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pcsecurityhelper/">https://sites.google.com/site/pcsecurityhelper/</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I got hit with this unfortunately. It was a fresh install, so I simply did another clean install using a USB with Windows 10 on it. However, I was wondering if anyone here was able to analyze the source to see if the trojan had anything else packaged with it other than breaking the MBR. I'm super paranoid about there being something else (like a keylogger for example) hidden that a basic reinstall wouldn't catch. I was considering using diskpart's clean all command to zero the drive before reinstalling another clean copy of Windows. Does anyone happen to know if doing this would cover my bases (or as aforementioned, was anyone able to analyze the source code/knows someone who did to verify its contents)? <br /><br />Sorry for the paranoia. This has been the first bad download for me in over a decade - all because I was an idiot and too tired/lazy to check the fosshub file. I just want to make sure it's 100% dealt with and that it isn't hiding in the BIOS or somewhere that a normal reinstall wouldn't cover.

I recommended Testdisk because people said it worked for them. Well, thankfully your data was retrieved. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Hopefully this will give anyone unfamiliar with the process the confidence to do it on their own.
