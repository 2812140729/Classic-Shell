		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey guys,<br /><br />loving Classic Shell!<br /><br />One thing I'm missing: From my old XPSP3 PC I'm used to use the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key when changing folders in the Explorer to (sometimes) open the new folder in its own window. That is still supported by the win8 Explorer by pressing &quot;Ctrl&quot; while double clicking a folder. However, the Classic Shell &quot;UP&quot; button does not support &quot;Ctrl&quot;. It would be great if you could add support for that. Should be quite easy to do. Just when pressing &quot;Ctrl&quot; when the &quot;UP&quot; button is activated (either through mouse-click or keyboard shortcut) please open up a new Explorer window for the &quot;UP&quot; action and leave the current Explorer window untouched. This way I could restore the behaviour I'm used from XPSP3.<br /><br />Thanks!!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In Windows 8, the Up button next to Back/Forward buttons is added by Microsoft so Classic Shell doesn't add it. But you can use the &quot;Up&quot; button from the Explorer Toolbar. That will open the parent folder in a new window with Ctrl+Up clicked.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ooops, I thought the &quot;Up&quot; button next to the Back/Forward was added by Classic Shell, haha!<br /><br />Anyway, I've enabled the Classic Shell &quot;Up&quot; button and I can confirm that holding the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key while clicking this button with the mouse works as expected. *However*, I can not make this work in any way with keyboard shortcuts. Having setup &quot;Backspace&quot; as the additional keyboard shortcut for the Classic Shell &quot;Up&quot; button, pressing Ctrl + Backspace doesn't work at all. Nothing happens. Even if I define &quot;Ctrl + Backspace&quot; as the shortcut for the &quot;Up&quot; button, it still doesn't work as expected: In that case the &quot;Up&quot; action is performed - but in the same window. So the &quot;Ctrl&quot; + &quot;UP&quot; works only with the mouse, but not with the keyboard.<br /><br />So one half of my feature request still stands: Basically all I want is to have identical behaviour to XP: When pressing Backspace I want the current Explorer window to switch to the parent folder. When pressing Ctrl+Backspace, I want the parent folder to open up in a new window. This is currently not possible to achieve with Classic Explorer, as far as I can see.<br /><br />Thanks!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I understand. The key thing here is that no GUI changes are necessary which keeps the development time low. Basically the keyboard shortcut for the &quot;UP&quot; key just needs to support &quot;Ctrl&quot;, too, and react as if the button had been pressed with the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key pressed. So it's a rather simple change and should be easy enough to implement.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />There is no built-in way for a shell extension like Classic Explorer to handle keyboard. The only way I know how is by installing a keyboard hook. Dealing with keyboard hooks is dangerous. I don't believe this feature is so important to justify it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure I understand. I already have a keyboard shortcut active for &quot;UP&quot;. It's in the Classic Explorer 4.0.2 settings:<br /><br />Title Bar -&gt; Additional shortcut for the Up button [BACKSPACE]<br /><br />I've set this up so that the key [BACKSPACE] activates the &quot;UP&quot; functionality, like it used to be in XP. It works well, so no complaints there. The only thing that doesn't work is Ctrl+Backspace. In XP it opened up the parent folder in a new window. All I'm asking for now is that if an &quot;additional shortcut for the up button&quot; is defined, that you also support the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key, too, to open the parent folder in a new window. You already need a keyboard hook to support the current option, right? So supporting &quot;Ctrl&quot;, too, should not be any more dangerous, or am I wrong?
