		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So far I have enjoyed the Classic Shelle start menu replacement since Windows 8 / Server 2012 and would be sad to let it go: It's deployable (MSI), customizable, likable, usable and a lot more!<br /><br />But the recent Windows 10 (1703) issues it seems like we have to make a new decision. Having explorer.exe freezing on a regular basis makes the application less usable and unfriendly for the average user.<br /><br />Ivo seems to be busy with other projects and since it is a &quot;one-man-project&quot; we seem to be stuck. So far it has been a fantastic product and we owe Ivo a huge THANK YOU! <br /><br />Things changes and unfortunately Ivo and MS changed at the same time - Ivo working with other projects and MS &quot;breaking&quot; Windows 10 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Ivo&gt; If you read this, could you please give us some kind of info if/when you might have some time to look into the issue? <br />Perhaps you could consider open-source it again and let other developers look at the problem?<br /><br />Cheers!

Haven't hit a problem yet as far as I know.  Lately I've had an occasional UNC connection problem with that machine, but I'm doubting CS has anything to do with that.<br /><br />I too would be sad to see Classic Shell go.  My 8.1 laptop would be mostly unusable without it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, it really depends(and each version of windows brings its own unique bugs); a few people are reporting explorer restarting repeatedly, others have experienced the menu not opening, or hangups.<br />Personally I haven't hit a problem either with 1709 and classic shell (i have hit a few other problems, like my computer freezing when i try to minimize a DX11 game in fullscreen(window))<br />Even if you have the same version of windows as someone, drivers alone are often enough to cause an issue on one pc, and not another. but then you factor in all the other UI tweaking software, people are bound to run into issues)

In fact, Classic Shell has helped me deal with a bug of the Task Bar being transparent on secondary screens, I just set it to use CS transparent and it was fine <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'd happily donate $20 or more for continued development of CS if issues with compatibility become a problem. For now though, CS is mostly feature-complete for me, so apart from possibly compatibility fixes there's no need for more features in my opinion.
