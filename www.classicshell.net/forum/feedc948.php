Classic Shell was the FIRST thing I installed when my Windows 8.1 decided not to boot up anymore and had to reinstall.  We went to Windows 10 at work and without it, I would absolutely hate the new OS!

Personally, I sent $10 for each of my computers.  I've encouraged clients to donate, but I like your idea, mfetzer.  I'm going to start adding $10 per install to my bills and then donate the same here.  This product is just too good for the greedy bleeps I do work for to get it for free!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4941">Bowserb</a> — Fri Apr 03, 2015 1:03 pm</p><hr />

It's all about volume. Two billion USB cords, that's only 6 per US resident, leaves you a tidy $1.3B to buy your own boat with and a fleet of delivery trucks.

Let me preface this by saying this product is the greatest thing since sliced bread and a must have.<br /><br />My question:<br /><br />While currently well less than 1 percent of our clients run Windows 8 (due to requirements of stupid softwares they are forced to use... in fact a year ago we were still selling XP systems, slowly able to go to 32bit 7s, none of this stuff really ever worked on Vista just because it took so long to update the software that 7 came out first), we are starting to see some Win 8 use. In fact, 3 machines so far out of a couple thousand. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I would like to include Classic Shell in any Win 8 / Server 2012 installations from hereon forward.<br /><br />I understand that it's 'free' for commercial use. HOWEVER, I want to make out clients pay. It's a great product, they have lots of money, it will make Windows 8ish OS acceptable for use in their business... but the cheapskates will NEVER donate, trust me.<br /><br />CAN I charge them some amount, and then turn around and DONATE that amount? I.e., is that permitted by the licensing.<br /><br />If so, what's a 'resasonable' amount in people's opinions. Don't say 10 cents. Don't say $100. I was thinking five bucks? ten bucks? What do you people think, and what do people usually donate for this sort of of (of the ones that bother to donate).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9040">mfetzer</a> — Wed Jan 14, 2015 7:44 pm</p><hr />
