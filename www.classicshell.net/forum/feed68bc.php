Omg they look great. I really like the first one. Thank you so much for making the scrollbar. It was the right call to grey it up a bit because when I was playing with tenified the menu doesn't work with white backgrounds. I chose to use Smoky instead and decided to add a color tint to match my wallpaper. I'm very happy with the transparency so it was fine. I did try to edit the bmps of the scroll/bar search but after a couple of trial and errors I retreated to using the original version. <br /><br />I edited Smoky's search bar to white (+bmp) and another one to match the glass opacity accent color. It won't work with white accents tho. <br /><br />The settings I used was a purple tint with a +25 glass opacity. I actually liked it more than just white. <br /><br />I attached screenshots, my settings, edited skins &amp; start button if anyone wants to replicate them.<br /><br />Thank you again!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16354">crvst</a> — Sat Nov 26, 2016 6:39 am</p><hr />

Hi crvst<br /><br />I decided to abandon what I made so far, because if what you really want is near white,<br />then the best skin is Ivo's Windows 8 skin7.<br />It is stuck on transparency 181/255. What I did was make everything same color, <br />and put in your thin scrollbar. That scrollbar created speedbumps, hurdles, and moats filled with sewage.<br />I had to put an option in case someone wants to use skin without menu glass, like on Windows 8.<br />Make sure to set button correctly, or you will see scrollbar's unmentionables.<br /><br />Settings on Windows 10<br />So either put CSM &quot;Glass opacity&quot; setting at 50, or 0. In my opinion 0 is better.<br />Turn on &quot;Overide glass color&quot; option, and set up a white color like 220<br /><br />If you are on Windows 7 there are other menu glass settings to use.<br /><br />If you want to edit the skin bitmaps to lower transparency, everything has to match,<br />like scrollbar parts, and programs background. The thin scroll bar creates the biggest challenges. <br /><br />Anyway I think I'm done. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> It's not going to look like the picture above. <br />Will look more frosty foggy. I still have the old partial finished skins,<br />if somebody wants to continue further with it. I put them in zip.<br /><br />Notes <br />I don't have any knowledge of how to make area on left side of scrollbar thinner.<br />I left the borders the way they are. Is not that hard to edit the bitmaps and selectors to make flat.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Fri Nov 25, 2016 9:26 pm</p><hr />

I looked at your new mockup picture. Looks very nice.<br />It will be hard to duplicate that.<br />The whites are still close to white. Very transparent.<br />Unless you are on Win7 using a faint dark text glow in a theme,and heavy fonts, <br />it's going to be hard to see white text on, near white backgrounds.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok. I just see you have picked another skin to modify more easily. <br />In that skin, instead of the bitmaps having different alpha value, it's the bitmap mask.<br />The bitmap masks would need to go to an image editor to adjust alpha values, and put back again. <br />Looks like at standard 191 alpha.<br />Hey, maybe black text is better on that menu?<br /><br />This is where it starts to get more complicated. To have transparency, many bitmaps need to be 32 bit alpha bitmaps.<br />Like selectors, program tree background changed to different alpha/color text value. <br />The reason the submenu selector looks very see through, is because it is not a real 32 bit bitmap. <br />It is only 24 bit with that text color.<br />If you want semi transparent scroll bar, most of those parts too, and the search bitmap box. <br />Probably a few more that I forgot.<br /><br />Are you making your skin for Win7, or Win 10?<br /><br />I'm trying to change my test skin to blurred left column. Not working too well on Win 10.<br />If I make it frosty white, cant see white text. If I put in light smokey grey, text is starting to be readable, but now looks dull grey. <br />Adjusting this stuff is really up to the person and the operating system. The blur on Win 7 is more transparency with less blur radius. <br />Win 7 also does not have as much residual glass color. <br />I'll try a little more tonight to see if I can do anything more. <br />Tomorrow night I'll upload the partially complete skin, for you to take parts out. Like the scrollbar parts and reuse.<br />I did increase brightness from 42/255 to 150/255. My taste or rather low contrast eyes are different than yours.<br /><br />Here is picture of it. I have color masks turned off, with small icons. <br />CSM settings have 24 sized small icons. Glass opacity at 0. I never did anything with the submenus.<br />Never used the a menu like this. I got scared of no 2nd column. I had to put a few links in. <br />It's odd having a search column so narrow.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2016 9:09 pm</p><hr />

Thanks! The frosty blur is not only for the sidebar but for the whole menu. I didn't need the 2nd column bec I have the shutdown button moved to the system tray like in linux. <br /><br />That sidebar is perfect but instead of dark grey, can it be white? or offwhite? <br /><br />Okay so I played with the Tenified theme and tried to make it white. I attached the edited skin theme. Roadbumps are making it more transparent like in your screenshot. Also the fullglass opacity isn't applied to submenus. And the hover colors/opacity being inconsistent. <br /><br />Thanks so much for your help.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16354">crvst</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2016 7:33 pm</p><hr />

After logging off last night,<br />I played around with Win 8, 7 style skin.<br />I partially modded some parts to see how a scrollbar could work,<br />put second column as 128 alpha and dark grey brightness.<br />I put your picture behind menu to see what it looked like on Win 10.<br />(Win7 os has smaller blur radius)<br />I set small icons at 24 size.<br />Here is the screenshot.<br /><br />It would be nice if you had a real screenshot, or your working on, skin file.<br /><br />Ok, I understand you want the left column as blured frosty.<br />Frankly I don't even beleive it if you got it working with a programs tree on left, without a second column.<br />How would one shutdown system through menu?<br /><br /><br />I've been wrong before on stuff.<br />I remember when a coworker said passenger jet planes fly 5 miles above earth, until I looked it up. <br />Boy was I wrong. It always looked like a mile or less.<br />Anywhere from 8 to 11 miles high!<br /><br /><br />If it's the left you want frosty blur, I would not modify the menu bitmap below 64 alpha,<br />because from past experience, transparent parts of scroll don't work properly.<br />Hmm, if what you are using is really &quot;Classic Skin.skin7&quot;, there are no menu bitmaps!<br /><br />I have to go.

Hey, thanks for the reply! <br /><br />It's the default classic skin for 7style menu. I removed the 2nd column and tweaked the icon size through the settings panel. <br /><br />&gt; It would require modification of 32 bit menu bitmap to make your desired rgb brightness/alpha transparency<br /><br />I believe this is what I need. Because I already placed this: Main_opacity=glass &amp; Main2_opacity=fullglass --- but it had no effect on the skin. <br /><br />&gt; Could start out with your grey menu color rgb at 45 up to white 255/ transparency could try middle of the road 128 alpha <br /><br />Where do I tweak this?<br /><br />Edit: I attached a mockup. So basically just mimic the glass effect on the taskbar as the startmenu background.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16354">crvst</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2016 4:00 am</p><hr />

Not sure what I'm looking at in the picture.  <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> I don't know what a classic skin7 theme is?<br /><br />Is it a 7style menu with entries deleted in second column, with altered slices to cut off second column,<br />or is it full alpha transparency at zero, in second column?<br /><br />Taskbar blur works differently than menu blur.<br /><br />If you want to make second column with blur (fullglass), even without a glass mask, glass color will show at a low level. <br />Turning csm Glass opacity setting to 0 can help reduce glass color further. <br />It would require  modification of 32 bit menu bitmap to make your desired rgb brightness/alpha transparency<br />Could start out with your grey menu color rgb at 45 up to white 255/ transparency could try middle of the road 128 alpha  <br /><br /><br />It would require this text below as well:<br /><br />Main_opacity=glass<br />Main2_opacity=fullglass<br /><br /><br /><br />If you made the scrollbar already - great.<br />If not, it can probably be done, but the width will automatically stretch to make regular size scroll size. <br />You could make the stretching part as dark menu color on left of white area.<br />It would end up with dead space on left between text and white skinny thumb bar.<br /><br />I could be wrong on a lot of what I just said.  <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />That's about all I can say.
