Great tool for using instead of classic menu <br />Ewa reviewed classicshell: <br /><br />‎, ‎September ‎18, ‎2012, ‏‎2:35:17 <br />: Bardzo dobre, polecam (Very good, I recommend.) <br /><br /><br />Willem Ratte reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎September ‎18, ‎2012, ‏‎12:27:47 <br /><br /><br />: Useful and grateful! <br />Eyebrows reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎September ‎15, ‎2012, ‏‎5:42:55 <br /><br /><br />: Dude! *Dude!* Windows 7's absurd &quot;snap newly opened folders to the bottom&quot; behaviour for the tree pane in explorer.exe has had me frustrated since the day I decided to upgrade from XP. Your little program has just enabled me to actually interact with my filesystem in a sensible way again. I love you so much right now. I actually like 7's start menu so I'm glad you've made your fixes all modular and configurable. ClassicShell *also* seems to solve (as a side effect of the way it adds itself to explorer.exe, I'd wager, but still) the issue in 7's explorer.exe requiring a physical click in either pane in order for mouse scroll events to be delivered there, so I no longer need the WizMouse application to fix that, which itself causes issues with some games. You, to coin a phrase, are the hero this city deserves. I am hoping you've got a donate button. <br />mason barnes reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎September ‎8, ‎2012, ‏‎4:08:39 <br /><br /><br />: good job classicshell <br />GizmoChicken reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎September ‎8, ‎2012, ‏‎11:42:42 <br /><br /><br />: GREAT!!! Not only does Classic Shell bring a start menu to the Windows 8 desktop, it brings a start menu that, in many ways, is BETTER (and certainly more configurable) than the start menus found in previous versions of Windows. And so I for one am happy that Windows removed its start menu so that I can now add &quot;Classic Shell&quot; in its place. Thanks to Classic Shell developers for providing such a great product. And thanks to Microsoft for finally allowing for upgrading the start menu. I especially appreciate that Classic Shell offers (under the &quot;Controls&quot; tab) a way to configure hot-keys for 1) opening the classic start menu and 2) going to the Windows 8 &quot;metro&quot; start screen. But I'll just note that the menu descriptors under the &quot;Controls&quot; tab are a bit confusing. In particular, the menu descriptor &quot;Windows start menu&quot; would be better labelled as the &quot;Metro start screen&quot; (or similar) so as to avoid confusion. Once trivial complaint: I notice that, after selecting &quot;skip metro screen&quot; on the &quot;Windows 8 Settings&quot; tab, the metro screen still briefly flickers before the desktop loads. Not a big deal, but irritating nonetheless. <br />mictex reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎30, ‎2012, ‏‎10:18:23 <br /><br /><br />: What can I say, the integration is seamless, fast, VERY customizable and it just works. With every new version it gets even better and makes Windows 7 as well as the the other related versions of Windows more enjoyable to use. Thanks <br />Steve Hornby reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎27, ‎2012, ‏‎5:10:00 <br /><br /><br />: If you purchase a new PC with Windows 8 pre-installed, you'll NEED this app! It adds features that aren't present in Windows 7 too, by the way... It's lean, solid, stable, endlessly customizable, and free. What more could you want? <br />layerxuhl reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎25, ‎2012, ‏‎7:58:27 <br /><br /><br />: Excellent! <br />OpenID User reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎25, ‎2012, ‏‎7:00:45 <br /><br /><br />: This was successful in my endeavor to restore that old and familiar Start Menu (not the new Metro Start Menu, the old one since Windows 3.0). And so I give a mighty thanks to the developers of Classic Shell, now I can find my way around Windows again! <br />Ignus Fast reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎23, ‎2012, ‏‎8:54:46 <br /><br /><br />: Classic Shell is FANTASTIC! And for those who would say some people are stuck in the old world and &quot;those who have been desperately holding on to Windows XP&quot; - yes. That's correct. Because the Start menu had become an overly complicated, over sized mess. I actually really like the new &quot;Don't call it Metro&quot; Start screen and application interaction. But I still like the speed, simplicity, and functionality of the original Windows XP Start button. Now I can have it all, and to the haters, kiss my ass! <br />barnyrubble reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎21, ‎2012, ‏‎1:51:03 <br /><br /><br />: Great for Win8. Gets rid of that awful quilted tablecloth and returns me to the proper Windows Desktop with the Windows orb and Menus for easy access to my programs. I hope it still works in the final release of Win8. If MS prevents programs such as this from doing their stuff then I will not use it. It appears to me that Win8 should not be called Windows at all since all Metro apps appear to work only in full screen so you cannot work in multiple programs copying and moving content from one program window to another or dragging and dropping files from Explorer into programs such as Adobe Audition.....something I do regularly. I am referring here to Metro only. Thankfully we still have the old desktop available to us but once that is gone we are back to one program at a time like old DOS. <br />Tommy reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎20, ‎2012, ‏‎12:29:56 <br /><br /><br />: Windows 8 really needed this! Now with disabling hot corners! <br />DNML reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎18, ‎2012, ‏‎10:22:58 <br /><br /><br />: Classic Start Menu 3.6.0 turns Windows 8 RTM from a big nuisance into a great operating system, getting rid of all the irritations that Microsoft created. I do a lot of software testing, and have a 3-monitor setup, in which I use the left and right monitors for full-screen virtual machines or Remote Desktop sessions. Using Windows 8 on the right-hand monitor without a Start Button is such a pain - when I try to click the hot corner, I just minimise all the windows on the central monitor (having got the Aero peek square next to the clock). So great to have a Start Button, even if I actually use it to open the Metro Start Screen. Good to have the option of the old Start Menu too, if I want it. It's also fantastic that you can disable the hot corners in Desktop mode, but they're still active in Metro mode - the perfect combination. Finally, it's great to be able to boot straight to the desktop. In short, Classic Shell lets me use the Windows 8 Desktop as a normal desktop PC, without any irritations from Metro, but also lets me try out Metro without it getting in the way. A truly fantastic piece of software, thank you very much! <br />Gary Rough reviewed classicshell: <br /><br /><br />: cool addition to standart Windows desktop features, just awesome! <br />David Long reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎13, ‎2012, ‏‎2:47:45 | David Long <br />: OMIGOODNESS, you just removed 75% of my frustrations with Win7. Thank you SO VERY MUCH. You have done a beautiful job implementing these `lost` features -- it is seamless and `just works`! I have sent a donation. I just wish I could give you 10 instead of one. <br />Tony Austin reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎10, ‎2012, ‏‎7:08:22 | Tony Austin <br /><br /><br />: Despite rumors that Microsoft has killed this capability in the final Windows 8 RTM &quot;gold&quot; package, the Classic Start Menu seems still to work with the RTM version. (It's a week before I can get my hands on the RTM code, but a friend with with the right &quot;connections&quot; has managed to get an early copy of the RTM and has demonstrated this to me via screen sharing.) Yippee! ... It looks to be THE way to avoid the clumsy &quot;Metro&quot; tiled interface for desktop non-touchscreen mouse-and-keyboard interaction with Windows 8. Eat your heart out, Microsoft, for doing away with the Start Orb and trying to block attempts to come up with an alternative, <br />Albert Sauser reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎4, ‎2012, ‏‎5:19:47 | Albert Sauser <br /><br /><br />: great! it's the same start menu like in Windows! <br />Rex reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎2, ‎2012, ‏‎5:59:42 | Rex <br /><br /><br />: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Back to a sane interface. Why did they have to &quot;improve&quot; it by jumbling and scrambling or removing everything that made sense. Maybe OOPolution of the brain synapses. Now I rediscover that things I spent 15 years getting used to are back in a logical order and still work. Here's an idea for new development: All MS developers need to accept, through a secure encrypted network -- mini-bombs. No effect until they reach a critical mass (say &gt;10,000 or so) then they get blown to ***** for being voted counter-productive. <br />Clay Greenham reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎August ‎1, ‎2012, ‏‎8:18:10 | Clay Greenham <br /><br /><br />: interesting tool, thanks to this app I had a strong deja vu <br />Chuck Renner reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎31, ‎2012, ‏‎9:19:41 | Chuck Renner <br /><br /><br />: This should be the default shell that should install with the OS on every version of Windows from XP to 8 (XP, Vista, 7, 8), and many more to come. This is an awesome shell! THANK YOU!!! <br />largo reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎28, ‎2012, ‏‎1:57:59 | largo <br /><br /><br />: hello thank you for this great log I put the dll in French is the forum for those who are interrested Excuse me for my english not good @ + <br />Russ Halloway reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎13, ‎2012, ‏‎12:51:32 | Russ Halloway <br /><br /><br />: Since the dawn of &quot;alternate start menu's&quot; I've always considered them, without hate or malice, a waste of time and energy. Since the dawn of Windows 8, I consider them, specifically &quot;classic shell&quot;, freeking awesome hah. Yeppers life is good with classic shell <br />Volkan KIRIK reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎11, ‎2012, ‏‎2:26:16 | Volkan KIRIK <br /><br /><br />: Thank you very much! <br />Shravan Sharma reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎11, ‎2012, ‏‎8:39:13 | Shravan Sharma <br /><br /><br />: ---&gt;Classic shell brings back old familiar startup menu of winxp for Vista/Win7 ---&gt;Lots of options/settings ---&gt;Stable software <br />Martin Plamondon reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎July ‎10, ‎2012, ‏‎10:57:32 | Martin Plamondon <br /><br /><br />: Hi, I love it, being able to avoid Metro screen and have a start menu back in Windows 8. Just one thing, in Windows Explorer, could you make the toolbar a ribbon tab for Windows 8, it's taking too much space as a toolbar with the ribbon not hidden. <br />Rafis reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎28, ‎2012, ‏‎9:39:37 | Rafis <br /><br /><br />: What a great tool!Great software, makes comparing and merging al lot easier! <br />Janka Helmutz reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎23, ‎2012, ‏‎11:07:39 | Janka Helmutz <br /><br /><br />: have used this program for many months now since I first read about it. I use it on windows 7 and on Windows Vista. Because the default Classic start menu on Vista has limited functions and of course you don't get the Windows XP start menu either. <br />Annet Kalipso reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎23, ‎2012, ‏‎2:11:31 | Annet Kalipso <br /><br /><br />: Classic Shell is an awesome program. I much prefer it to the Vista and Windows 7 Start Menus. It's tremendously customizable and you can export and import all the settings so that they can be applied to other computers and login ids. It also provides a great replacement for XP-style function buttons on Windows Explorer. Again, customizable and one can export and import settings. I use its Classic Explorer function to hook to a good third party filesystem search program to replace the execrable VistaW7W8 filesystem search. But the best thing is that Classic Shell 3.5 puts its beautiful Start Menu on Windows 8 Consumer Preview, turning a sow's ear into a silk purse! Settings from W7 will even import into W8, providing instant customization. <br />Archibald Zook reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎15, ‎2012, ‏‎8:37:50 | Archibald Zook <br /><br /><br />: I have used it since years. <br />Mathew Thompson reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎8, ‎2012, ‏‎8:02:07 | Mathew Thompson <br /><br /><br />: This is the best tool for Windows that I know. <br />Algernon Mcdougall reviewed classicshell: <br />‎, ‎June ‎8, ‎2012, ‏‎7:54:18 | Algernon Mcdougall <br /><br /><br />: Amazing!

With Windows 7 Classic Shell offers substantial improvements not just in familiarity but in form that follows function. On Windows 8 and Windows Server 8 Classic Shell will be essential for anyone that needs to get work done with a PC due the integration of Metro as Start Menu, the inability to multi-task when some interface features are running, and massive increase of user input required (mouse clicking and window manipulation) to accomplish the same tasks that on previous versions of Windows required no input, a single mouse click, much less input intensive operation... On Windows 8, Classic Shell will literally save lives on mission critical systems -- this is not an exaggeration, but first hand experience! It is a fantastic application, with a level of professional attention to detail that's astonishing for FOSS Windows software and Windows 8 would be useless without it. <br />Dylan Cannon reviewed classicshell: <br />, May 14, 2012, 4:25:32 | Dylan Cannon <br /><br /><br />: Very useful app. Thank you. <br />Oliver Schneider reviewed classicshell: <br />, May 09, 2012, 10:56:58 | Oliver Schneider <br /><br /><br />: Have been using it for some time now on all Windows 7 machines I have to use and must say this is one of the most useful things that I use on a daily basis.

Installing / configuring it, I had the explorer menus go away, and it took a while to get them back, and this is exactly why I needed this. Leave it to microsoft to take a perfectly good user interface and re-invent it. It's as though they took an automobile and moved the pedals and steering wheel to new locations. This puts some of the controls back where I like them. Especially frustrating with Win7 explorer is the way the file tree would randomly re-adjust itself just when you wanted to expand a branch, and this seems to fix that. Have to use it some more to confirm. <br />Logan Morris reviewed classicshell: <br />, March 19, 2012, 2:23:13 | Logan Morris <br /><br /><br />: Fast and simple. <br />reviewed classicshell: <br />, March 13, 2012, 5:22:53 | <br /><br /><br />: The GREAT application what is giving back a human-face for Windows 7.

Please sell this to MS I am so pleased that you shared this at no cost. <br /><br />, January 4, 2012 | pjfarr <br />Reverting back to the &quot;flyout&quot; style Start Menu from XP was great, but not only reinstating the Explorer Toolbar but making it fully customizable is where it's at for me. The redesigned Start Menu and absence of the Explorer toolbar were the first things I noticed—and immediately hated—about Win7. Classic Shell goes a long way to not only get around that, but add many extra functions/options as well. A truly valuable find. <br /><br />, November 17, 2011 | Ricardo Canepa <br />Excellent tool.

Without Classic shell, I probably would not be using Windows 7. (still maintain an XP machine for important work as it is.

It is disgraceful that Microsoft took the attitude, &quot;screw you, it's gone and it is not coming back&quot; - without even offering any excuse whatsoever during development. Poll after poll showed that 40% of Windows users indicated a preference for the classic start menu and Microsoft just thumbed their nose at every one of us. <br /><br /><br />, July 7, 2011 | EricSo happy to find this program.

Interesting to see great creative comments like the one from Marc-Andre. Make's me think that he works for MS. But regardless, he and MS both agree that all these thousands of people downloading this program, including the 500+ that already gave it great <span class="posthilit">reviews</span>, should all be forced to change into something they think is better.

Can't stand Windows 7 without it. <br /><br /><br />, February 01, 2011, 10:37:42 | Old FaithfulA MUST HAVE for anyone who has become aggravated by Microsoft's relentless efforts to steer users away from the clarity of the file management concept that made the initial success of Windows, based on what information really is and how it is actually stored on a computer and how humans classify it in real life. This utility is a great start. Now if only this concept could be expanded to take over the rest of Windows dismal, fuzzy 'Internet Explorer'-like shell, whose sole purpose seems to be FORCE users to organize information the way it sees fit, instead of allowing users to organize it in personally meaningful ways! <br /><br /><br />, January 31, 2011, 6:29:07 | Well, the idea is excellent.

Every citizen should get Classic Shell! <br /><br /><br />, January 01, 2011, 5:54:41 | Bantak788This program has made my life worth living. I've resisted moving away from Windows XP for years since the new Windows menu is so incredibly annoying. When I built a new machine, I added a solid state drive and knew it was best to just move on to Windows 7. Fortunately, I had already discovered Classic Shell and knew that it would be a relatively painless process. It's an almost perfect program. Classic Shell is light-weight and unobtrusive, and it provides me with the flexibility I need to customize the Windows Start menu to work the way I want it to work instead of forcing me to use somebody else's conception of what the &quot;perfect&quot; menu should be. With just a couple of clicks in the settings (switching the Left-Click/Shift-Left-Click behavior to display the regular menu and then setting the Windows Start Menu to a Cascading All Programs menu), I was able to get 90 percent of what I wanted (both the cascading sub-menus instead of the cramped standard style and proper default sorting with folders listed first). My Windows menu is better than it's ever been. I work with a lot of client computers (mainly using Server 2008 or Win7), and it's always a traumatic experience when I have to use the out-of-the-box Windows menu. ALL HAIL CLASSIC SHELL! <br /><br /><br />, December 31, 2010, 3:21:49 | Great! <br /><br /><br />, December 31, 2010, 4:42:15 | Hey ibeltchev, I really must thank you for this wonderful little program.

I had already been through Explorer++, Q-Dir, QTTabBar,Total Commander, and Ultra Explorer. Changes to the Start Menu as described almost seemed impossible, so I did not think about it. When I tried installing Classic Shell, I had a major problem. Half way through the installation, I got an error saying permission was denied to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs It took quite a while to figure out what was wrong - &quot;System&quot; was not showing up in the Security Permissions for that &quot;..\Start Menu\Programs&quot; folder, and adding that solved the issue finally. Then the program installed, and it froze Explorer, and the start bar was doing weird things - and I thought - well, another hacked together half job. But what the hell, I rebooted, and opened up explorer. It seemed to be working all right. I followed the instructions in ClassicShellReadme.rtf and started tinkering around, first with Explorer, then with the Start Menu settings. After half an hour of tweaking things - I am now sitting here amazed at how perfectly everything is EXACTLY the way I want it - I mean EXACTLY! If someone was to wander by and look at me working, they would never know I am not on XP ! My Start Menu uses so that the icons are small - I can have my own folders at the top of it with my own frequently used programs - and the cascading sub-menu is such a relief after the pain of using the Win7 new Start Menu. Your page: &quot;Why Classic Start Menu?&quot; says it all perfectly. Explorer - with the tree line structure on the left! (Windows XP Classic - Navigation Pane Style). I thought I would never see that again! I can instantly see now where I am down the tree - how many subfolders down, and the left arrow &quot;Back to&quot; the last folder - such a time saver. And the beloved ALT+Enter to see a file/folder's properties, used so so many times a day is back! And back to the old dialog for File/Folder conflicts - the new Win7 one was so invasive. The only &quot;tweak&quot; missing from all this was found long before - putting back the Quick Launch area (available on most Win7 tip sites). ibeltchev - you have made Windows 7 behave the way I want - a way that is efficient - and conducive to productivity. Thank you so much for your amazing work - and for sharing it with the community. You have made my time on my laptop (many many many hours a day) much less stressful; much more enjoyable! <br /><br /><br />, December 25, 2010, 11:57:01 | sleclireThis is just awesome! If you want those treelines back OR if you want those triangles (expand/collapse buttons OR folding buttons) to not fade out when you're not mouse over them or the explorer navigation pane focused (by ie. shift+tab to it) then this can be done for the left side nav pane of explorer <br /><br /><br />, December 15, 2010, 1:18:34 | Essental for me to be able to tolerate Windows 7.
