		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No doubt the &quot;categories&quot; in the searchbox results of v4.0 were added with the best of intentions, but such segregation ought to be optional, given that the category names are just clutter in the display, and one more thing (or in this case, two more things) the brain needs to filter &quot;out&quot; when reading the results.  Unless there's a setting for this I'm missing.<br /><br />Of more significance is that the &quot;See more results&quot; entry is completely superfluous if Windows Search itself is disabled (it opens an empty explorer form, even when there literally <em>can</em> be no more results to see). As the settings menu is aware enough to &quot;warn&quot; the user that the search service and/or indexing is disabled, surely it would be logical to remove the &quot;see more&quot; entry under such circumstances, if not optionally (as with enforced categorisation, above, hopefully).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I never said they didn't serve a purpose (though it be a tenuous one, visually) - I've read enough posts around here to know that despite your admonitions, users have been continually insisting upon using the searchbox and start menu as a whole for years now as a means of searching everything (linking whole drives, etc). No matter how much you repeat that &quot;it was never intended for that&quot; they do it anyway, and this sort of thing is inevitable. Such is life. <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />And, I appreciate that you have tried to accommodate that in as reasonable way as possible - but forcing categorisation on those who never asked for it is a bit odd. For example, even the item-enumeration counts appended to the labels are misleading - they don't accurately represent the number of &quot;programmes&quot; found, the count also iterates any links under those programmes, such as help-files, or web-pages, or whatever the installers decided to add there. I realise it's beyond CS's purview to waste its time differentiating the meat from the roughage - which is why the idea of categorising seems misplaced (to me) in the first place.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - I'm perfectly happy to go back to 3.6.8 in perpetuity - I just thought I'd mention the first small signs of UI bloat surreptitiously sneaking in, since you've been so notably careful to keep that sort of thing out up until now. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />

By disabling the Search service or by uninstalling Windows Search from &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; ? On Windows 8.1, I don't see the ability to remove Windows Search at all using &quot;Turn Windows features on or off&quot; so the only way to disable it on that OS might be to stop the service.<br /><br />When the service is stopped and disabled on either Windows 7 or Windows 8, &quot;See more results&quot; opens Explorer and continues to perform a real-time search. Only the indexing part is switched off. So in that case, &quot;See more results&quot; is not superfluous.

Real-time search continues to work. Although I understand Kilmatead's point about having &quot;See more results...&quot; optional, maybe it should have a checkbox that doesn't depend on the service. Something like &quot;Categorize search results and show link to see more results&quot; so users can get 3.6.x behavior and won't feel categories forced. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Granted, my approach is extreme, but as Ivo himself put in the changelog, &quot;...the unparalleled customizability you've come to expect from Classic Shell&quot; has always extended to <em>not</em> having to see UI elements just as much as it applies to actually <em>having</em> those elements in the first place. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GauravK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But why should &quot;See more results&quot; be hidden if the Windows Search service is stopped?

That might be removing the search control from everywhere. But it doesn't look like future versions of Windows are going to allow removing Windows Search completely. At the most, you can disable the search service in Windows 8.1, Windows Search is not listed as a removable component.<br /><br />There might be users who turn off the indexing only but want to use &quot;See more results&quot; in Explorer. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
