Well-worth the price, especially for us old guys, with failing eyesight, who still like Windows 7. I'm one of them, and the Classic Shell team has been of great help to me. <br /><br />I do hope it will remain open to updates oriented towards Windows 7.

Easy, I made it myself.<br /><br />1 part Windows 8 (about 3GB)<br />1 part Windows 8.1 (a couple of Gigs)<br />1 part Windows 8.1 &quot;update&quot; (a few more gigs)<br />1 part Classic Shell (couple of megs)<br /><br />Stir together and bake (while downloading)<br /><br />Let me ask you what is the result if not Windows 9? Windows 10 promises the best of both 7 &amp; 8. Well, it's all there with the above ingredients, and classic shell is the icing on the cake. I have my desktop, I have my start menu, I have some familiar shell extensions, I have metro apps when I want them...<br /><br /><br />The only thing missing is running metro apps in a window, and snapping to four corners instead of two sides. I can live without that!<br /><br />Anyone I show my machines to thinks I'm running 7. It can be 8 in a split second, with all its tile glory when I touch the screen.<br /><br />So I'm gonna call it Windows 9.

A really polished, useful program that made me happy.<br />Been using it for more than one year now on a Win 8.1. <br />I dunno what I would have done, MS really botched this one (what the $%#!$ were they thinking?) and alternatives, well, suck.<br />I need to have my programs neatly sorted by topics, it is part of my everyday workflow (it takes a just a tiny more effort after every installation but it's really worth it, the efforts repays for itself every day)<br />I've been doing so since forever and I was really shocked that MS decided to take that away from me for no reason at all. <br /><br />At that point, Classic Shell saved me.<br />It is really neat and tidy and polished and looks just right, and behaves just right, and it's customizable exactly as mush as I needed it to be, and that is all very important to me, so, GREAT JOB you have done.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, it is not many applications that can claim to be used by me as often as this one.<br /><br />TL;DR: THANK YOU!

I work for a school district in the IT department and its installed on all of our workstations (~500). Thanks for following group policy settings regarding the start menu and the ability to load settings via the command line, it makes my life so much easier. Your idea of a start menu is clean, to the point and you can customize it as you see fit, also the search function is the best as far as I'm concerned. <br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Michael

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First post and it is a THANK YOU!!  I managed to get registered after changing my log in name.  Well, my home state backwards works well. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  <br /><br />I have been a user of XP Pro for many years.  I still use it at work and at home.  Only recently have I bought a lap top that had Windows 8.1 on it and have been experimenting with Windows 10 Pro preview.  I have a laptop that my wife gave me (after I bought her a new laptop) and have put in an 80gb HD in it.  Older Dell dual core processor with 2 gb of ram, but 32 bit processor.  So I installed Windows 10 preview  in 32 bit I burned from an ISO from Microsoft.  Working well.  The very FIRST thing I installed was Classic Shell 4.2 beta.  It has been working wonderfully!!  I am a die hard XP fan and user and hated the interface and the lack of getting around in the last few OS that have come out .... and then I discovered Classic Shell.  I can make the computer useable.  I like to add the My Computer icon and all the other familiar icons on the desktop and use the desktop and could care less if the &quot;tiles&quot; thing comes back up.  I like the &quot;run&quot; command so I can use regedit.  I like the run command to use shell:startup and put in my second most liked program, Clip Clear.  Tiny program that lets you clear whats on the clipboard by merely clickit it in the taskbar with the mouse pointer.  Frees up ram that way but with the Classic Shell and it's configuration, I could easily add the small executable to the starup folder and it appears in the taskbar every time I start Windows.  Use Classic Shell in both the 8.1 ver as well as the 10 version.  <br /><br />Thanks again for allowing a XP user to have some familiar ground to navigate in.<br />Vern

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Unfortunately, I don't have a long paragraph to post here, but I'd like to say thank you regardless.<br /><br />My parents bought me a computer around 2 years ago, and it had Windows 8 installed on it. Initially Metro was fun, but it quickly became a nuisance, as the Taskbar doesn't provide enough space for the Applications I wanted on it, from games to modding tools, so I began freaking out about the lack of a proper Start Menu. Not long after, I found Classic Shell. Finally, my computer was usable, and I could get on with...alright, fine, modding videogames <img src="../../neomariogalaxy.bplaced.net/board/img/smilies/colonseven.html" alt="" /><br /><br />But it doesn't end there - I later started skinning for Classic Shell, and that was...different. A pleasant experience, definitely. And so, I was on my way to discovering a peculiar fondness for beta versions of Windows Operating Systems. Basically, I never would have discovered the joy of Virtual Machines, Windows Longhorn, or what fun it is to create themes for Windows 8(.1, actually) and matching Start Menu Skins if it weren't for Classic Shell. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I said I didn't have a paragpraph to post, and I wasn't wrong - seems I had 2 of them <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />

Even the once-promising Windows 10 Start Menu is starting to get up its own rear with complexity and counter-intuitiveness.  Classic Shell allows me to keep the most fundamental, well-designed, and of course, pretty variant of the Start Menu to have ever existed: Windows 7 version.

She has Windows 8.1 <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" />. The Metro UI got the best of her. After we installed Classic Shell, she is happier.<br /><br />Now, my Computer is a Windows 7 Ultimate one. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> With Classic Shell, I am more effective in work and, can customize my computer to my heart's desire.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />I am one of those kids who tinkers around with every little setting on my computer to make it more personalized, efficient, and, quicker. I tried Windows 7's one on a 2nd user profile thinking it would change my normal one! Suprisingly, it is quick and, I loved it so much, I installed it on my main account! <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8-)" title="Cool" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I am getting a new computer soon (My current one is outdated and, about to fail <img src="images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very Sad" /> ) and, this will be the first program installed on my new Laptop! This new computer will duel boot Windows 7 Ultimate and WIn 10 and, in both Operating Systems, it will make the ultimate user experience!<br /><br /><br />Overall, I highly recomend this program to anyone who wants customization and efficency of there Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 PC!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I want to say thanks to the Author(s) and all people involved in the making of Classic Shell. Every great once in a while,<br />there is a program that comes along that restores functionality and does so in a way that does not<br />eat up Ram or CPU functions, while restoring that functionality that was taken away by the original programs authors (Microsoft). <br /><br />I have installed Classic Shell on many, many Windows 8 Machines. For some folks it was either Classic Shell or take the Machine BACK<br />to the store for a Refund. The Day Microsoft decided to use Metro in such a way as to change the entire Windows Experience was the <br />day they crippled the Win 8 platform. Making it so folks really raged over moving to Win 8.<br /><br />This program has helped more folks in my community then I can count. Microsoft should be paying Classic Shell for fixing things.

As a small-time tech guy for family / friends / office, this is literally the first software I install when setting up my user's computers. In fact, someone asked me today if I recommended an upgrade to Windows 10. My response: &quot;Not until classicshell works out a few more bugs. There is no way I'm giving up the UI they've protected for me over the past few years!&quot; So, kudos to all involved for a job well done.
