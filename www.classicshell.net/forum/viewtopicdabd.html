The Beta 3.9.0 installer tried to initiate a &quot;close&quot; for DVRMSTOOLBOX (framework add-on service for Windows Media Center) resulting in an endless/fruitless loop where user options to &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; just repeated... Ctrl-Alt-Del allowed shutdown option of Restart. After Restart, Beta 3.9.0 install seemed to complete its mission (although slowly in perception). It seems to run ok with a menu and taskbar on two screens.

Found out there is startup of 3.9.0 but there is popup of error message two times again, do some changes of config / settings of Clasic Shell. Seems to me the Skin (changin) section is responsible but i am not sure. The far i remember Import settings.xml of 3.6.8. to 3.9.0 did not changed back to former skin (smoked glass), had to do that by my own..<br />4a: did uninstall of 3.6.8, no error message, reboot PC --&gt; it was gone, install Folder gone. Did instal of 3.9.0 --&gt; same error message again. --&gt; uninstall, reinstall of 3.6.8 and i went to Bed..<br />4b: as written i downloaded setup.exe again today, because of postings inside forum saying there is new Ver 3.9.0 out. But there was no change of size ( byte size compared to download done yesterday ) found.<br />5: used that fresh download, did install again, hoping it will change the error problem..but..

Saying something like windows is configuring..BMP...too fast to read it all <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /> Seems to be able to do its &quot;install&quot; half way, then stop itself and displayin above missing file message.<br />Same if i use the now Button, restart PC, the very same Moment Desktop is shown, same kind of auto-install starts up. Thought this is part of Classic Shell install, needed to get it work. <br />4: Because of been unable to find such bmp.msi i hit that &gt;abbrechen&lt; Button to make that error / search Window to disappear. <br />5. After that i can see Classic Shell running by hit the Start-Button. If i open its Config a can see: Version Numb. I am told it is 3.9.0.<br />But: the reason why i was talking about that setting of 3.6.8 backup.xml File is: 3.9.0. is running, okay ..fine.. but at least former 3.6.8 setting of wanted / former used skin is gone. The far i remember: If i go to skin chosin option, inside that running 3.9.0, if i try to change skin away to wanted / former one, that &quot;auto-install bmp.msi not found error message&quot; popups again. And again if i try second time change it. There is no need to close first of those msi-error messages too, do second try to change Classic Shell skin results in an second msi-error message.<br />6: No, i don't have any other startmenu, desktop adding / changing / coloring / tuning / pump it up software running, this is reason too, i thought that bmp.msi error belongs to Classic Shell Installation.<br />7: so if i am wrong, if this is an failure done by my windows, i am very sorry i wasted your time <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br />8: no bmp.msi at win 7 setup DVD found<br />9. no Change if NOD 32 Antivir is temp. stopped.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Looks like some system component that Classic Shell needs is missing or corrupted. When that component is requested, it tries to repair itself by running its installer again. I don't know what the component is. My hunch is something to do with loading images (like PNG files or icons).<br />It may not be an original Windows component. It may be a third-party image filter or something. Without direct access to your system it is hard to tell anything more definite.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, so this error is happening on your system because something related to Windows Installer MSI of that driver component/suite is messed up.<br /><br />Did you try installing Classic Shell 3.9.0 after repairing the driver? And if it asks again for BMP.msi, locate BMP.msi in the folder where the driver files are, or in the temporary directory (%tmp%) and point it to that file. Unless you point that dialog which asks for the MSI to the missing BMP.msi, it will keep showing that error. Once you point it to the correct MSI file, then you should be able to install Classic Shell's newer version.

But no bmp.msi on Desktop PC to be found.<br />Found Differences: Install on Desktop PC changes skin away from wanted smoked glass, but i am able to reconfigure it without problems.<br />On Laptop at first i wasn't able to do same. 3.9.0 keeps default system colors. Then i noticed: some posssible Options of Smoked Glas Skin were gone, hit Reset Skin Button gave it back.

I have had Steam installed a long time and it still works OK. The installer popup appears right after dismissing the Classic shell (3.9.0) &quot;install complete&quot; (or whatever it says) window, and then also every time right after restarting windows. Everything (including Classic shell 3.9.0) seems to otherwise work fine in windows except for these two things:<br />1) Outlook 2010 complains about not being the default mail program anymore, and cannot load images in mails; this happens every time when starting Outlook and it starts working properly only after doing a repair install of Outlook.<br />2) When trying to type something in the classic start menu search box, the installer popup also appears immediately (how odd!).<br />I have tried alternating between 3.6.8 and 3.9.0 a few times, always uninstalling the other first, restarting computer and then installing the other. Always the result is the same: 3.6.8 works without problems, and 3.9.0 causes the same problems.

No valid source could be found for product Steam.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Ah, I see. Now it is starting to make sense.<br /><br />Some features that are new for version 3.9.0 need to know the target EXE for each shortcut. Some shortcuts (so-called &quot;advertised&quot; shortcuts) don't actually store their target but rely on the MSI system to resolve them. So if such shortcut is considered corrupted, MSI will try to repair it. I think that's what you are seeing.<br />It is hard to know which particular shortcut is triggering this behavior. Try launching all of Steam's shortcuts and see if one of them complains. You can do that in version 3.6.8. You can do that even from Explorer, just so we exclude Classic Shell from the process.<br /><br />The reason you are seeing this error after installation is that when the start menu is launched it scans all shortcuts and grabs their targets. Search may be doing something similar.

There is a &quot;Steam Support Center&quot; shortcut in my start menu Steam folder that causes the same install popup to appear!<br /><br />Could this somehow be improved in the new Classic Shell, some sort of alternate behaviour or at least a notification to the user of the real problem? Or is this MSI mechanism such that it cannot be meddled with?

So looks like the test is able to retrieve the shortcut properties without triggering the self-repair.<br /><br />BTW, looks like you are missing Support.url. &quot;state 2&quot; means INSTALLSTATE_ABSENT. Maybe you deleted it or it got corrupted. Does the Steam installer fail to self-repair?
