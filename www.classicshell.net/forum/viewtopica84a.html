One day the last classicshell version made by Ivo will cease to work on windows 10, which is sad as well. <br /><br />I've been using classicshell since 2010, and have seen the hard work that Ivo has put into it over the years which was awesome. Ivo could have left us in the dark about development stopping, and never see a new update again &amp; remain closed source. But Ivo decided to have his project open source again &amp; notify us all of it, which is awesome of him. Not many projects do this, so kudos to Ivo.<br /><br />If Splitwirez can take up the torch, it'd be cool to see that in development. ^.^<br /><br />Also, Merry Christmas to everyone! ^^

You've done a wonderful job all this years, and i am one of those many out there who can &quot;enjoy&quot; W10 to a certain degree thanks to Classic Shell. That being said, i do understand your point of view, life changes for everyone, our RL can be very demanding, and we have to adapt, sometimes dropping old projects we dedicated a lot of time to in the past, it happens all the time.<br /><br />You take care and i hope all your future projects come true and as successful as this one was for sooooo many years now. Big hugs!!<br /><br />PS: i edit to say... MERRY XMAS FOR EVERYONE ^^

I stopped using CS a while back but have just reinstalled it for one reason only, to change the Start Button. If someone could just take that part of the code and make a standalone program to just change the Windows 10 Start button, that might be a successful venture.

If you hadn't done it, and literally millions of people like me and the others around here hadn't found Classic Shell to be a way for everyone to make Windows palatable...  Would Win 8.1 have just <em>failed</em>, and Microsoft had to regroup and make a Windows 9 more like 7?<br /><br />I guess a corollary question is this:  <strong>Presuming no one keeps Classic Shell working as well as you have been, might it spell a well-deserved doom for Windows 10?</strong>  That could be a silver lining in all this.<br /><br />Imagine, a Windows 11 where Microsoft has lost all its awesome 3rd party developers and actually has to create an entire system that all integrates together again...<br /><br />Thank you for all you have done to make Classic Shell so great.  It will continue to be my Start Menu until Win 8.1 freezes over.<br /><br />-Noel Carboni

Although I do update to Windows 10 everything I get my hands on (and has a valid, upgradable license), Classic shell has always been the third piece of software (after Firefox and a decent virus scanner) I'd install. So it was just now, when I read this sad news on the front page. I've helped countless friends and family members with your software, who would else be lost without the familiar start menu and other interfaces. Microsoft really dropped the ball when it decided to 'tile-ize' and 'ribonize'.<br /><br />Thank you for open-sourcing Classic Shell. I hope there will be people that will continue development and I'm glad with the GitHub repository, I think it's an excellent way to go forward with development. Although, nowadays, I do most of my development work in Linux (and most code is about back-end work), I have done Windows (VC++/C#/.NET) development and will be curious how the project will move forward. Sadly I'm too busy with other projects (both professional and voluntary), I think I'd be able to actively contribute.<br /><br />Thank you for Classic Shell all these years, and to whoever who will keep this software relevant in the future, a thank you beforehand as well.

I've been using it for years on every system I build and/or help other users with. I add my sincere thanks for helping make the Windows experience more tolerable.<br /><br />Imagine all the users who will be calling up their tech support (e.g., friends, relatives) in a state of panic when MS inevitably breaks Classic Shell's functionality and they can't use their PC normally.<br />Had I not checked the forum, I would have been blindsided. Too bad you can't push to every installation a large warning prompt with this news, perhaps float a tooltip on the start button on mouseover or when opened via Win key (I suspect most people haven't disabled tooltips on their machines).<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the effort up to this point, and best wishes on your future endeavors.

Maybe I start studying the source but I guess my programming skills aren't good enough for it. Maybe some other genious is able to update the sources if necessary...<br /><br />Just done a donation before it's too late <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Many thanks and I wish Ivo, the other developers/skinners and the whole forum a nice 2018!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yes, it would. In most cases classic shell works even on the latest version of windows 10. However for 1-10% of people that is not the case. and eventually its likely that an update will come that breaks compatibility for everyone.<br />However there is usually an option to roll-back. so if you want you can update until classic shell stops working, then try rolling back to the last working version. Or just find a version you are comfortable with and stick to it like glue...<br />I would also suggest making a 'recovery' flashdrive with a confirmed working version. because microsoft may not provide old versions later.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />That Windows is harder and harder to customize - in some cases: fix - is, in many ways and, to my mind, all-things-considered bad. It's part of the reason I am on Windows 8. And, being on Windows 8, is why I need ClassicShell. Thank you, Ivo, for your work.<br /><br />PS: Here's a mini bug report, in case anyone knows an easy fix or a workaround. When pinning PowerShell to the ClassicShell menu, it appears, initially, simply as a menu item; only after it has been clicked does the 'run as admin' submenu option appear; and on reboot the cycle repeats.

Does not have many tentacles touching Explorer operation.<br /><br />The way I see it, some smartie programmer will figure out what consistantly crashes CSM on Win 10,<br />and change the code just enough, to keep it working for years.<br /><br />Has anyone else besides Clemens, jiriw, thx_4_the_hard_wk, come forward after looking at Ivo's code?

I despise UWP. The basic idea is cool, being able to develop a piece of software one time and have it run on Xbox, Windows 10, and mobile. What I hate endlessly is the fact that it's so closed down. I haven't done much (well, anything) in terms of UWP development, but thats not even all.<br /><br />There is also the fact that personalization is such a joke in Windows 10. Remember Windows 2000 and prior, where you could change the color, size, font, etc. of virtually every single UI element? Even the Windows 7 Aero theme (which I adore to no end) doesn't allow this much in terms of customization. Plus, on Windows 7 and prior, you could easily just swap over to Classic theme to have all those same options. Windows 8 and 10, no classic theme exists. There are hacky ways to enable it, but it's buggy and doesn't work at all with UWP apps. You can even install UXStyle on Windows 7 and have virtually no restriction to theme capabilities. On 10, UXStyle is buggy and even then, certain UI elements just don't look right.<br /><br />My hope is that someday MS gets it together and restores some of these features, or that Windows tinkerers and whatnot are able to make it work. It's these reasons and so many more that I plan to stick with Windows 7 well after they drop support, and will do so as long as I can reasonably do so. I still have several XP computers that work just fine and aren't virus nightmares, so I don't see why Windows 7 would end up being this danger area the minute they stop pushing updates.<br />&lt;/rant&gt;<br /><br />Just want to give my thanks to Ivo and all the others involved for all their hard work on this wonderful piece of software!

I started using Classic Shell mostly for the Explorer enhancements for servers (putting some of the things back on the menubar and such that were deprecated by windows) and once I found out about the group policy support, this became something I put on every terminal server I've ever built, since this makes it SO EASY to customize and lock down the start menu, something even natively with group policy we can't do very well with the Windows start menu...<br /><br />This made all my terminals so much easier to deploy.  <br /><br />I've read through this thread and everyone is talking about their client PC's, but there are a lot of us who will really miss this on the server side of things...<br /><br />Thank you for all the time you've put into it this far...  Now I'll have to hope someone picks it up and runs with it moving forward, since otherwise I'll have to redo how I lock down my terminals.  This made it so easy...<br /><br />But I understand completely where you're coming from, since the 6 month cycles are killing software all over the place, even Microsoft's own.  Last year's creator update broke WAV previews inside of Outlook 2016 and it's never been working since...  So if they can't even manage to come out with an update that doesn't break their own software, we know that third party programs are going to be HUGE casualties...<br /><br /><br />Best of luck, and you and your efforts with this are going to be GREATLY missed...<br /><br />John
