 <strong>script</strong> <br />That's the &quot;Windows 8.2&quot; Concept I'd like to see made into a menu style. Also, it'd be nice if there was support for transition animations, such as fading in, or sliding in from an offscreen location. One other thing I'd like to see is an option to show the Classic or Windows Start Menu when the button is pressed and held for a second or two, like the button in the video. Same for the Windows key. Just an idea, no big deal if I'm asking a lot...<br /><br />...which I suppose I am. Another thought, what if rather than having a dedicated Windows 10 style, there was just an option to replace the second column of the WinXP or Win7 styles with a Modern UI column (or tack one on the side of a Win2K-style menu)? That would allow the Windows 7 Style to BE the Windows 10 style, and it would permit the Windows 8.2 style to be like the Windows 7 style, but with the second column on top of the first one.<br /><br />EDIT: Just realized that I had kind of assumed that there was going to be a Windows 10 style added at some point. Woops <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> Wait, is that going to happen?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9454">Splitwirez</a> â€” Sun Jul 05, 2015 4:35 pm</p><hr />
