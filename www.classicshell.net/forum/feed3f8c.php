Yes, you can. You can show/hide the Apps item in the right column from the Customize Start Menu tab. You can show/hide the Apps item in the All Programs tree with the &quot;Show Metro apps&quot; setting in the Main Menu tab.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Fri Jan 01, 2016 5:37 pm</p><hr />

Does that mean that on Windows 10 if you use the Windows 7 start menu style it is not possible to hide the &quot;apps&quot; entry in the start menu?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12344">coup27</a> — Fri Jan 01, 2016 2:53 pm</p><hr />

To remove the &quot;Apps&quot; folder, go to the tab called Special Items in Classic Start Menu settings and uncheck the option &quot;Show Apps menu&quot;. This is for the &quot;Classic&quot; or &quot;Classic with two columns&quot; styles, one of which I guess is what you are using.  <br />  <br />You also might want to right click the items inside the &quot;Apps&quot; folder which are of no use to you and click &quot;Uninstall&quot;.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sat Dec 26, 2015 8:38 am</p><hr />

Greetings! I absolutely love this program, (and a huge thank you for all you responsible for building and maintaining and updating it).<br />I simply have one small problem:<br />When I used Windows 7, I had the shell set to classic mode, like it looks in anything below windows XP, and in win XP if you customize the start options.<br />Now, while it's like this, it's great, however when I reach for my start menu, I want to be able to get to the few programs I use rather quickly.<br />So, I located the folder where &quot;programs&quot; is listed, and created a secondary folder, &quot;apps&quot;, and started moving all the shortcuts to my programs to that folder.<br />And it was great. It worked great, showed up and worked fine in classic shell, I had full access to everything without having to locate its folder, avoid clicking the uninstall shortcut or something stupid, etc. Speed is key.<br /><br />And then I upgraded to Win 10. <br /><br />First, once I got past the initial nightmare that was, and managed to get classic shell working again on it, I found much to my disappointment &quot;Apps&quot; listed between Programs and Documents folders. (the one I added was listed above programs, still is, but this is some shitty windows one)<br />I tried right-clicking apps, but nothing shows up, I tried locating the folder, nope. I can't delete it.<br />Which leads me to believe it's being superimposed on there, and isn't actually there, much like the documents folder, or the settings folder. <br />I don't mind documents or settings, but what I DO mind is having a duplicate Apps folder up there, I keep accidentally going to that one for my programs. <br /><br />My request is this: The ability to delete this god awful thing. A good chunk of the stuff it lists, I don't even have on my system. It's an ad basically! <br /><br />Thanks for your time, sorry about this. If there already is the ability to delete this thing, would someone please be so kind as to link me to a walkthrough on how to do so? Thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12308">LORDSANTAENGLISH</a> — Sat Dec 26, 2015 2:24 am</p><hr />
