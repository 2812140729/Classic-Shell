Just because the issue crops up on both of your test systems, doesn't mean its a common issue. it just means whatever is causing the issue, is likely installed, or tweaked on both of your test system. I have personally tested it on 2 separate physical machines. and knowing IVO, he probably tested it in a variety of configurations/OS's.<br /><br />We are happy to troubleshoot and find the issue, but we need people who have the issue, and are willing to work with us. You are under no obligation to do so, but until someone does step forward, the issue might not be resolved.

There is no way they work differently for you.<br />Most likely the problem occurs sporadically, and it just hasn't happened yet with 4.2.6.<br /><br />I suspect the problem is that sometimes the code thinks incorrectly that the menu is already open, and doesn't open it. I am changing how I check if the menu is open, and I'm adding more logging.<br />In the next few days I hope to post a test version for you to try.

Then go to the Classic Shell folder, and replace the file ClassicStartMenuDLL.dll with the one that is attached. It is compatible with 64-bit version of Classic Shell 4.2.7, but it should probably work with 4.2.6 as well. Run ClassicStartMenu.exe to restart the menu, or simply log off.<br /><br />If you don't see any problems for the next couple of days, then most likely the problem is fixed. Report that here.<br /><br />If the problem happens again, follow these instructions, VERY CAREFULLY:<br />1) Go to the folder %LOCALAPPDATA%\ClassicShell in Explorer. Delete the file WinMenuLog.txt. Don't close the Explorer window<br />2) Open the start menu settings and go to the Controls tab. Make sure that the mouse click, Shift+click, the Win key and Shift+Win are all set to open the Windows start menu. Don't close the settings<br />3) Try to open the Windows start menu 4 times in the <strong>following order</strong> - the mouse click, Shift+click, the Win key and Shift+Win. After each try wait 5 seconds. If the attempt was successful, close the start menu by pressing Escape or clicking on the desktop. DO NOT use the Win key or the start button to close the menu<br />4) Make a copy of the WinMenuLog.txt file immediately<br />5) Click Cancel on the start menu settings. This will revert any changes you made to the controls and will go back to your previous settings<br />6) Post the results here - include the text file, and report which of the 4 attempts to open the start menu was successful<br /><br /><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Note that the attached file is only for Classic Shell 4.2.7. If you have a later version of Classic Shell installed, it may not fix your issue and this fix below is most probably already included in versions of Classic Shell after 4.2.7.</span></strong>
