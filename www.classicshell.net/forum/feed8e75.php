I fully agree with @Gaurav I can add to the issues he mentioned the mixed icon theme of Win10, with some icons from Vista and some redesigned, also the fact that the taskbar remains textured/themed even when using Classic Theme. Moreover, when using Classic theme there is no text on the taskbar at all, neither on buttons, nor in the clock, also, the 7+ Taskbar Tweaker option to reduce space between tray icons does not work on Win10. Also, Metro apps do not work with Classic theme in Win10 (they work in Win8).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1730">Anixx</a> — Tue Mar 28, 2017 12:32 am</p><hr />

Thank you for all your responses.<br /><br />Whether Windows 10 is worse or better is not something I really have a say in, it's the latest operating system and therefore the school would like to use it on all our computers. I know it has its faults although I've been using it at home for a year or so now and it seems alright, I really liked 7 and wasn't fond of 8 at all. I know it was mediocre when it came out, but (aside from the start menu and force installed app rubbish) it seems okay now.<br /><br />If there's any solutions to the 800 thread issue or if anyone has any ideas for things to try, please let me know<br /><br />I'll look at Winaero Tweaker - Gaurav<br /><br />Thanks<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17403">CosmicThing2</a> — Mon Feb 06, 2017 4:03 am</p><hr />

OK may I suggest you another app that might help you taming Windows 10 even more - Winaero Tweaker: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/the-list-of-winaero-tweaker-features/">http://winaero.com/blog/the-list-of-win ... -features/</a><!-- m --> It's another free project to help out similar to Classic Shell. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Although personally, Windows 10 is unbearable for me so I never use it. I refuse to use such a junk piece of software, so it's 8.1 for me unless there is really something useful added in Windows 10 in the future. But Microsoft has run out of great ideas and innovation. They only add useless gimmicky fluff now that is of no value to me. Most of their &quot;ideas&quot; are copied from competitors, and since there is no long-term continuity or guarantee of any feature staying around, their software suddenly becomes completely worthless for me - because you paid for some commitment and now they're backing off that commitment - it's an epic breach of trust. Spending money on such crap would be the biggest mistake ever. Plus anything that requires the cloud or interacts so much with the cloud gets a big thumbs down from me. I will never use it because their grand plan is to hold everyone hostage as they pull off any kind of random meaningless changes FORCIBLY to make themselves rich while offering nothing new really that is of significant value or use to you. Again, it's a violation of trust and reduction in value in the &quot;improved&quot; version.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2017 9:28 pm</p><hr />

<div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1. End of Microsoft support means nothing. Security patches ending won't cause your PC to get hacked unless you run unknown apps from untrusted sources. It's just a tactic that Microsoft uses to scare everyone. In fact I am willing to take that 1 in a billion chance that my PC will get hacked because of a security vulnerability. That is lesser of the two evils, the one option being extorted by Microsoft perpetually with ridiculous changes that you can't say no to. Microsoft will bleed you dry without offering any additional value, and while secretly eliminating what you paid for.<br /></div><br /><br />I agree, and it feeds into point 3) actually. All the systems I manage have automatic updates turned off. Win10 does require that the IT admin really _manage_ the systems. Automatic, userland stuff just won't cut it. Once you do this though and patch regularly using either WSUS or a third party product like WSUS Offline, things are about as covered as they can reasonably be.<br /><br />To be fair though, up until probably Win8 or the early 8.1 period we were allowed to be lazy (admins) because the quality of MS patches was, with a few exceptions, pretty high. Things changed however and now you can't rely upon the downloaded patches to not break your business. Its an admins worst nightmare actually. So, for mine, I no longer allow _any_ systems to automatically patch up. <br /><br />Instead, I rely more upon perimeter defence and internal software controls to keep out zero day exploits ... zero day problems being things you can't guard against with patching in any event.<br /><br />However, its a game you can't ultimately win to try and continue to run systems that are not manufacturer supported. For a while it all seems fine, but try and run Vista on a new system today ... its not always easy. The longer the older system remains unsupported the worse things get. Note, I understand that this is not an OS structural thing, but 'unsupported' triggers third party manufacturers to no longer test against or support the older systems. Third party support contracts against business applications often won't be entertained unless you are also running a 'supported' base OS.<br /><br />Of course, in the home use realm, none of the above is important. You could quite happily run win7 for many many years.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2. The driver model hasn't changed between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 so it will be possible to run Windows 8.1 for a very, very, very long time. Even NVMe SSDs have native drivers in Windows 8.1. USB 3.1 - yep. Bluetooth Low Energy. Yep 8.1 supports. Miracast? Yep. There hasn't been any hardware technology evolution or revolution big enough to require the dreadful abomination called Windows 10.<br /></div><br /><br />Sure. Win10 is really Win8.2 with a heap of bolt ons.<br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3. No amount of Registry tweaking, configuring and tuning can fix the awfulness of updates in Windows 10.<br /></div><br /><br />It can, but its not trivial. Home users with moderate knowledge will never get there, so, your point is well taken. I can't have random driver and other changes, let alone entire OS upgrades under the guise of an 'update' happening willy nilly in my business fleet. Its just laughably dangerous. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />4. UI inconsistences have increased 100 times more in Windows 10 vs 8.1. Settings and notification area shit is all over the place.<br /></div><br /><br />Sure. I concede that point. Its generally stuff that my end-users don't interact with, but sure, initially it all drove me nuts. Again, with significant tweaking, a lot of the silliness can be circumvented and Win8 or even Win7 functionality returned. I use, for example, the network flyout from Win8.1 on my Win10 systems. Its makes a lot more sense for VPN use than the rather foolish way Win10 wants to do it oob. Metro interaction is pretty limited, really only to the occasional forced use of the &quot;PC Settings&quot; thing. Mostly, the old Control Panel methods still work and can be presented either via CS or other ways.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />5. Windows 8.1 is the fastest out of Vista, 7, 8.1 and 10 in my benchmarks. Also besides synthetic performance, Windows 10 has real-world UI sluggishness issues due to use of managed code in the UI/graphical shell. Plus, it is unstable and breaks on its own. It also has loads of unnecessary crap which cannot be uninstalled, fully disabled and continues to take loads of memory. It also comes back when you do updates.<br /></div><br /><br />I've not seen this. Benchmarks for me are coming out so close to each other that theres nothing in it. Also, memory usage between the two is really similar, falling in Win10's favour once the 'junk' is stripped out via an SOE script (removal of modern apps, pulling various levers via the registry). New patched desktops here are utilising about 0.7GB before Office/AV or other apps are installed.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Windows 10 has severely regressed in several core areas:<br />1. Updates (or the way the OS is serviced) which affects user productivity and long-term stability and desired configuration<br /></div><br /><br />Yep, sure. no argument from me. It can be mitigated, but thats beside the point - it shouldn't have been released (and continue to be maintained) in this fashion.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />2. User interface which has pathetic usability. The entire UWP/Metro UI control stack should be canceled and something better based on modified Win32 controls for touch should be built. Making the controls usable still won't fix their awful design of most apps though<br /></div><br /><br />Again, my users, and myself, aren't subjected to the whole metro thing so to a large degree I can't comment. Metro apps are either uninstalled or hidden (thanks CS!) with only a few exceptions. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />3. Poor performance due to use of managed code in the OS unlike fast, low footprint native code (C++)<br /></div><br /><br />No comment. I just don't know. With Metro essentially gone in our installations, its presenting visually very much like Win7 but with significant speed improvements and some of the 8.1 niggles taken care of.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Gaurav wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />I think those who say Windows 10 is actually better than 8.1 or 7 don't have a complete understanding of operating systems and therefore cannot see just how bad it is. They have no idea of the crap they are accepting. What can I say - ignorance is bliss. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /></div><br /><br />I would have agreed back at release. In fact, we didn't roll out Win10 until a year later, and even then, there were enough problems to make us wary. However, in a managed environment with a proper SOE application, its presenting to our users in a way that they are more than happy with, and ultimately, its not about admins or programmers, its about end users. If it was a bear to use, they would complain, and they are not, they are happy - but its taken a significant amount of scripting and tweaking to get there.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15545">moopere</a> — Sun Feb 05, 2017 9:08 pm</p><hr />

I am afraid I don't agree:<br /><br /><br />1. End of Microsoft support means nothing. Security patches ending won't cause your PC to get hacked unless you run unknown apps from untrusted sources. It's just a tactic that Microsoft uses to scare everyone. In fact I am willing to take that 1 in a billion chance that my PC will get hacked because of a security vulnerability. That is lesser of the two evils, the one option being extorted by Microsoft perpetually with ridiculous changes that you can't say no to. Microsoft will bleed you dry without offering any additional value, and while secretly eliminating what you paid for.<br /><br />2. The driver model hasn't changed between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 so it will be possible to run Windows 8.1 for a very, very, very long time. Even NVMe SSDs have native drivers in Windows 8.1. USB 3.1 - yep. Bluetooth Low Energy. Yep 8.1 supports. Miracast? Yep. There hasn't been any hardware technology evolution or revolution big enough to require the dreadful abomination called Windows 10.<br /><br />3. No amount of Registry tweaking, configuring and tuning can fix the awfulness of updates in Windows 10. Updates that should have been 10 MB in size are 1 GB and are constant. To hide from the user how awfully bloated they are, Microsoft no longer shows their size so the user remains cluelessly deceived. Updates reset your customized stuff and completely kill your productivity. Imagine if Classic Shell reset all its settings every single time you did a point upgrade. Windows 10 updates are 100 times worse. They also impact web bandwidth when downloading and PC performance while they slowly install. Whoever worked on the updating stack should never again be allowed to touch a computer, let alone code. They should be sent back to the college or university they came from to learn efficient coding from scratch again. Until then, all their degrees and qualifications should be taken away. I haven't seen anything worse in 30 years of computing than Windows 10 updates.<br /><br />4. UI inconsistences have increased 100 times more in Windows 10 vs 8.1. Settings and notification area shit is all over the place. For example, there are 3 Defender UIs: <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C28Xt4gXcAEf0c4.jpg:large" class="postlink">(see this image)</a> AND a tray icon and weekly Action Center notifications! Windows 8.1 with the addition of Classic Shell is largely like Windows 7. You don't even have to ever see or use the dreadful Metro UI in Windows 8 except for a few areas like the Network flyout/tray pane. Whereas in Windows 10, the extremely crappily designed UI has infected more core parts of the OS. Everywhere, silly dumb undecipherable icons are used instead of text and everything is hidden behind hamburger menus that require more clicks. More classic Win32 desktop apps are replaced by extremely dumbed down Metro crap.<br /><br />5. Windows 8.1 is the fastest out of Vista, 7, 8.1 and 10 in my benchmarks. Also besides synthetic performance, Windows 10 has real-world UI sluggishness issues due to use of managed code in the UI/graphical shell. Plus, it is unstable and breaks on its own. It also has loads of unnecessary crap which cannot be uninstalled, fully disabled and continues to take loads of memory. It also comes back when you do updates.<br /><br />Windows 10 has severely regressed in several core areas:<br />1. Updates (or the way the OS is serviced) which affects user productivity and long-term stability and desired configuration<br />2. User interface which has pathetic usability. The entire UWP/Metro UI control stack should be canceled and something better based on modified Win32 controls for touch should be built. Making the controls usable still won't fix their awful design of most apps though<br />3. Poor performance due to use of managed code in the OS unlike fast, low footprint native code (C++)<br /><br />I think those who say Windows 10 is actually better than 8.1 or 7 don't have a complete understanding of operating systems and therefore cannot see just how bad it is. They have no idea of the crap they are accepting. What can I say - ignorance is bliss. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2017 11:15 pm</p><hr />

New system buyers won't have the option to regress to Win8.1 much less to Win7.  Corporate users, and those on VL will have some breathing room, but only up until the end of support for their chosen platforms.  In the case of Win7, extended support ends 2020, only 3 years away.<br /><br />I've got to say though, MS has done a worthwhile job of shrinking the OS.  Win8.1 and Win10 have a significantly smaller memory footprint than either Vista or 7 and, unbelievably to me at first, will run on almost anything.  I've got sample machines in my lab dating back to 2003/4, running P4 Prescott's which will run Win10 x86 ...<br /><br />But anyway, in the context of this forum, and of Classic Shell, the reality is that with a fair amount of registry tweaking, removal of pointless things (all modern 'apps' gone) and, most importantly, the introduction of CS, the Win10 experience for end users is like a speedier, more consistent version of Win7 - and they love it!  By comparison Win7 feels heavy and sluggish, Win8 and 8.1 have UI inconsistencies and other weirds that, for the most part, have been corrected in Win10.  <br /><br />A lot of my customers have VL availability but I don't find myself installing Win8.1 as a downgrade option.  Win10, with proper tweaking via an SOE script, is, imho, a better system.  <br /><br />OOB though, sure, its an aberration.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15545">moopere</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2017 10:35 pm</p><hr />

I suspect this may also be some poorly coded built-in Windows 10 process which is blocking the existing threads and launching new ones, which is why I suggested moving back to Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell. Windows 10 in my opinion is the most poorly coded release in the 30 year history of Windows.<br /><br />It is the crappiest crap of all crap. I've seen such extreme bullshit in the OS in the last 2.5 years that I will stay away from it for the next 100 years at least. It's an epic failure of good software engineering. Parts of it are very poorly architected/designed and the UI is worse than Windows 95. The reliability, stability, quality, value it delivers, ease of use, features - everything about it is outrageously bad and completely worthless, lacking in substance.<br /><br />For those who cannot judge its quality and cannot see its massive flaws, I saw tough luck. You have a weird obsession to stay on the &quot;latest&quot; OS no matter how bad it is, and nobody can fight that if you've made up your mind to ignore its deal-breaking flaws. The worst is yet to come. Windows 10 will only get worse from here on as it destroys everything that truly made the PC great. Microsoft will remove more features and value than what they are adding, and they will change it into a perpetual expensive subscription.<br /><br />My point is: you can use the OS you prefer but my two-cents advice is that you'll experience MASSIVE troubles CONTINUOUSLY with Windows 10 - it goes against the fundamental principle of software which is that it should stable, trustworthy, reliable and productive in the long term.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sat Feb 04, 2017 2:34 am</p><hr />
