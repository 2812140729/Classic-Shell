		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I found Classic Shell while searching for a way to get a non-transparent taskbar in Windows 8.0 (other stuff I'd tried didn't work right or wouldn't hold settings correctly). That was all I wanted, at first, and I didn't think I needed the other parts of Classic Shell and I was prepared to ignore them. But... <br /><br />Then I discovered the &quot;Classic Explorer&quot; part of Classic Shell. Wow! I love how it lets me customize so many aspects of how I want my files/windows/etc to appear. For instance, this might seem trivial to some, but it's important to me: Classic Shell lets me fine-tune/adjust the &quot;tree item spacing&quot;, in the Navigation Pane part of the preferences - that is so cool! I tend to have lots of nested folders to organize my files, so this particular feature makes it so I can see more files in less screen real-estate. <br /><br />So then I started investigating <strong>other</strong> aspects of Classic Explorer and found lots of other useful settings and adjustments. It's so much easier to navigate around Windows with all the custom stuff that Classic Shell makes possible. <br /><br />I never thought I'd say this, but - because of Classic Shell - I actually like Windows 8 <strong>better</strong> than Windows 7 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> or even XP Pro (I used to think XP was the greatest thing in the PC world, despite the XP hassles with ordinarily running as a non-Admin for security reasons). But now, thanks to Classic Shell, I feel like I'm essentially able to choose the <strong>best</strong> features of all those OS's and combine them into one easy-to-use computer. <br /><br />So I no longer have to dread or procrastinate about buying new computers when necessary, because as long as Classic Shell lets me customize stuff the way I want to, it's all good. <br /><br />Which reminds me, I've been meaning to donate but I kept forgetting, so I will do that on payday. I consider Classic Shell to be absolutely essential, to tame Windows 8 and restore peace and harmony <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> to my computing experience. Classic Shell makes all the difference in the world. <br /><br />Thanks again!

I hope Microsoft realizes that perhaps the biggest reason Windows 7 has remained popular and why many are refusing to move to Windows 8/8.1 is the disappearance of the traditional Start menu. Now I must thank Classic Shell team for what they have done. And this is given out free of charge? Awesome, awesome. Matter of fact, Classic Shell even does more than the Windows classic Start button does. What's more, it doesn't really change how your PC works; it just add a very useful shell. Again, Awesome, awesome!

Article on Windows 8 Disaster</a><br />Many thanks to the people in this discussion thread who referred to <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>Classic Shell</strong></em></span></a>. As a result of their comments, a couple of days ago I went ahead and installed it for a trial.<br />Most of the things that I dislike (and that's putting it mildly) about Win8 are related to poor ergonomics and the superfluous Metro eye-candy and and its kludgy functionality in the UI. Those aspects of the OS are backward steps <em><strong>- but the OS otherwise seems very good.</strong></em><br />However, pretty much all that I disliked is swept away by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>Classic Shell</strong></em></span></a>. It seems to be very stable too - which is a mandatory requirement for an OS interface (in my book, at any rate).<br />Perhaps the biggest bonus of <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>Classic Shell</strong></em></span></a> for me is in the restoration of the very good Win7-type Start Menu <em><strong>and the instant search of my indexed documents and OneNote files when anything is typed into the Search box.</strong></em> This had completely disappeared in Win8 and was driving me batty - and lots of other OneNote users as well, judging from the comments in many of the OneNote discussion forums.<br /><a href="http://www.classicshell.net/" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><strong>Classic Shell</strong></em></span></a> <em><strong>- definitely a keeper.<br /><br /></strong></em>(Hey, nice editor in this ClassicShell forum!)<br />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have always built my own desktop computers in the past. But I relocated to a tiny town from Portland, OR, and was spoiled by all the vendors in Portland. There are none here to buy computer components (motherboards, memory, drives, etc...) I found myself in a quandary. Now, having said that this town has limited outlets for hardware, we do, of COURSE, have a WAL-MART. (Where our workers can't afford to shop, and STILL the cheapest place in town!) So I purchased a desktop Gateway system, all set to go. And guess what? It came with WIN 8. I had read/heard about how disappointing the new 'gem' from MicroStuff was, but figured I could get used to it. Well, it was so distasteful to me, that after I set the desktop up, I proceeded to use my old laptop for most of my pleasurable work. THEN! I stumbled upon mention of Classic Shell on the 'Into Windows' website. I thought 'what can I loose?' So I downloaded, and couldn't be more thankful!! No, there was NOTHING to loose. What I didn't expect was how much I'd gain. Thank You, Thank You, THANK YOU!!!! Clearly, a lot of thought and appreciation for esthetics went into this product. I don't know how anyone could produce such a brilliant product, and then turn the thing loose for FREE! Unless, as implied earlier, some nefarious CIA connection is present. AH, what the hell. They already listen to everything we say on the phone, and text, and e-mail. Who cares? In a country where freedom seems to have been given a backseat to &quot;security&quot; (Albeit false security) by the mindless majority in our ever dumber and dumber populace, I don't even care if you are a CIA shill.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Much appreciation to all those who created this masterful solution. MicroTalent certainly shows less appreciation for its captive audience than you folks do. Very nicely done. Maybe TinyLimp (er, sorry. Microsoft) will toss you guys a few million for the rights to your product.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />

I wonder how many MS employees are using it...

For removing the Show Desktop button, you can use 7+ Taskbar Tweaker from <a href="http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker" class="postlink">http://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker</a>. It's been around for just as long as Classic Shell and fixes everything related to the Taskbar that Microsoft messed up.
