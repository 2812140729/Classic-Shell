		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hiya, my idea is to have a classic explorer that I can customize with images instead of icons. This will allow me to create a true classic explorer like the one in windows 98. <br /><br />Also to enable a menu bar (file, edit, view..etc) <br /><br /><br /><img src="../../i68.tinypic.com/wrdojt.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Things we'd need to make this happen:<br /><br />1. With the addition of icons, the ability to use images instead with a active/disabled state. This includes separators but without the states.<br />2. To be able to drag the classic explorer to the proper place. Already possible, but could be moved above the address bar, along with the file/edit/view menu bar.<br />3.<strike>To enable/disable the current back/forward/up buttons that windows 10 uses so that you can focus on the classic explorer.</strike><br />Possible with the program I attatched to my post.<br />4. <strike>To bring back the menu bar with file, edit, view etc.</strike><br />Possible with ribbon disabler. EDIT: It doesn't work on windows 10. I get the critical error about cortana and start menu not working.<br />5. To be able to place images anywhere on the explorer window, such as the picture of 'address' just before the address bar. Could be useful for adding custom items on the right side of the explorer window as well as having them elsewhere too such as items on the far top left, and far bottom right ( two different lines. ) A custom adress bar could be moved anywhere as well. Possibly separate toolbars would make this possible.<br />6. Move the classicshell explorer above the current address bar as well as menu bar. <br />7. A custom address bar. Using the program I have attatched to the thread, you can disable the windows 10 default one. You can move a custom address bar below the classicshell explorer like windows 98 has. You could also edit the address bar to look like the windows 98 address bar too.<br />8. A custom menu bar that you can edit &amp; etc with classic shell since the ribbon disabler doesn't work on windows 10.<br />9. A hover/hot state for button images like windows 98 has.<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: A menu bar is possible with ribbon disabler. Thanks to Gaurav for this, I thought ribbon disabler only disabled the ribbon, but didnt bring back the menu bar. EDIT: It doesn't work on windows 10, I get a critical error about cortana and start menu not working.<br /><br />As suggested by Gaurav, you can move the classicshell explorer by 'unlocking' the toolbar, then moving it. You can't however move it above the address bar.<br /><br />Update: By using a program made by Anixx called 'borderfix', I was able to disable the current address bar, plus the current back/forward/up buttons.<br />With this, classicshell explorer can enable it's own address bar so that you can only see the classicshell explorer, and not windows 10's default. <br /><br />You might need zero dump installed for this to work.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Debuggers-Decompilers-Dissasemblers/zero-Dump.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Programmin ... Dump.shtml</a><!-- m --><br />I've uploaded the borderfix program for Ivo to see.<br /><br />Image here:<br /><img src="../../i65.tinypic.com/nlelae.png" alt="" /><br /><br />Which is alot closer to the classic theme.

If you wanted to do an image that was 10x20 and you used a 32x32 .ico and on the same window have an image that was 80x120 and you used an .ico that was 128x128 how would classic shell behave? Can there be different sizes of .ico's on the same window?<br /><br />There would also be a noticiable border around those images as .ico only supports sizes of 32px and etc. This border would create unwanted gaps between back/forward/up and etc.<br /><br />Plus what if you wanted to use an animated .gif image or a .png or .bmp that has stacked images for an animated image?<br /><br />Is it not possible to move the classic explorer to a different place than it currently is? Id like to move it to the same place as windows 98 has it, instead of on the right side of explorer windows.<br /><br />What about adding custom items anywhere on an explorer window?

I think that adding more customization to your program would be <br />wonderful and provide users with more options than they currently have. I think that customization is the future of the <br />classic shell explorer.<br /><br />Sometimes it's good to do something new in order to move forward. Like how you changed the start menu from being a .ini to <br />a full out graphical user interface. The new gui was written from scratch wasn't it? <br /><br />Here's a quote from your old .ini:<br /><br />'; This file is used to customize the items in the classic start menu. You can add, remove or rearrange the items, as well <br /><br />as change<br />; their name, icon and functionality. The possibilities are limitless.'<br /><br />Do you not want to make the possibilities limitless with your explorer as well?<br /><br />I tried other explorer replacements as per your recommendation &amp; I think that classic shell is the closest explorer replacement right now to what I'm looking for. The only closest explorer replacement besides classic shell that I found has been abandoned since 2009. Classic Shell seems to be the only one that will skin the control panel. <br /><br />One huge difference to your program and the other explorer programs out there is that yours is integrated with the actual explorer <br />windows which will open with every window. The others are more of a program instead of a toolbar but won't open with the control panel.<br /><br />If anything, may you consider adding a custom address bar at least? As the one thing I'd pick to take from all of this.<br />I have an .ahk script attatched that removes the default address bar, to help create a custom address bar on a new toolbar. <br />The source code can be found here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic55c6.html?f=10&amp;t=3433">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewt ... =10&amp;t=3433</a><!-- m --><br /><br />My second thing that I'd pick if I could would be a customizable menu bar, since the ribbon disabler isn't supported by windows 10 officially yet, and that would actually give you customizability options unlike the ribbon disabler.<br /><br />Also, a happy new years to everyone! =)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I don't understand the purpose of the features you are requesting:<br /><br />- &quot;Custom menu bar&quot;<br />This will have to be implemented as a toolband. Did Microsoft make it possible for toolbands to be operated using the keyboard? I don't know. If keyboard operation is not possible, the &quot;menu bar&quot; you can have won't be a true menu bar, it can only be operated using the mouse, crippling 50% of the usability. It will be the same as the current Explorer toolbar, but only with text labels instead of icons. You can already do that using Classic Explorer Settings - configure the toolbar to work like a menu bar by disabling icons and using only text labels plus subitems. Plus, the &quot;File menu&quot; portion of a genuine menu bar cannot be implemented since registry/contextual verbs are not possible.<br /><br />- &quot;Custom address bar&quot;<br />What is the purpose of this? What additional or missing functionality can this offer that the current Explorer address bar does not have?<br /><br />&quot;Images instead of icons&quot;<br />- Again, why I don't understand? You can already put PNG images inside ICO files. So what's the functional purpose of this change?<br /><br />Any features you want implemented should have some usability, productivity or value-added benefits - which enable users to do something that's not already possible in Windows Explorer. I don't see the point of hiding Windows Explorer UI elements that work without issues and and replacing them with custom additions that pretty much do the same thing.

If keyboard operation is not possible, the &quot;menu bar&quot; you can have won't be a true menu bar, it can only be operated using the mouse, crippling 50% of the usability. It will be the same as the current Explorer toolbar, but only with text labels instead of icons.

I don't see the point of hiding Windows Explorer UI elements that work without issues and and replacing them with custom additions that pretty much do the same thing.</div><br /><br />I'll try to describe what features I'm asking for.<br /><br />1. a) The answer to your question if the menu bar could ever be operated with hotkeys with the keyboard, is yes.<br />This was possible with windows 95 to windows 7. I'm not sure about windows 8, or windows 10.<br /><br />b) Just having a custom menu bar would be good enough for me since the ribbon disabler doesn't work for me in windows 10. Sure, not being able to use hotkeys might be a drawback, but not a total setback. Being able to just use the mouse would be good enough.<br /><br />c) &quot;You can already do that using Classic Explorer Settings - configure the toolbar to work like a menu bar by disabling icons and using only text labels plus subitems&quot;<br /><br />This isn't a viable solution though. You should be able to have both the back, forward, up and etc buttons with the addition to the menu bar.<br />The menu bar should be on a separate toolbar from the navigation buttons.<br /><br />I couldn't find the option to disable icons, and use text labels. I did however find how to make subitems. But does that make it so that you can't use navigation buttons still? I'd like to be able to have a custom menu bar with the addition to the regular navigation buttons.<br /><br />Here's an image with subitems that I took:<br /><img src="../../i66.tinypic.com/28jzgqp.png" alt="" /><br /><br />d) &quot;Plus, the &quot;File menu&quot; portion of a genuine menu bar cannot be implemented since registry/contextual verbs are not possible.&quot;<br /><br />This, is very useful information, thank you. Does Ivo also agree with this statement? Replicating a menu bar, with custom items such as 'go' and 'favorites' is not possible because the registry/contexual verbs are not possible?<br /><br />I would say myself that it is possible, since browsers such as k-meleon has file, open, and also edit, cut, copy paste. If it wasn't possible, then k-meleon wouldn't have a menu bar at all, correct? Another program with a menu bar would be firefox, and kompozer too. How did they add the menu bar with commands there? I'd say 'if it's made, there is always a way to create it.' Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />Also, there are commands that already exist in classic shell that would help towards creating a menu bar.<br />An example of this is that under the menu bar in windows 98, you have the item named 'view'. Under this there are the options that let you view 'large icons' , 'small icons' , 'list' , and 'details'. Classic Shell currently has all of these options. There is also under the menu bar in windows 98 an item called 'edit' there you have the options 'cut' , 'copy' and 'paste'. Classic Shell has these options. I'd say that it'd be possible to have a menu bar with these options, as well as adding new ones too.<br /><br />If there are no registry/contextual verbs possible, then how were these created within classic shell? I'm sure that this also applies to new ones as well that if the current ones were created, so can new ones as well.<br /><br />Maybe I am missing something about what you meant about the registry/contextual verbs not being possible. Please fill me in if I am, thanks.<br /><br />2. a) The current address bar has the back , forward and up buttons next to it. We don't need these if classic shell provides these buttons. They are just in the way and is an eyesore.<br /><br />b) The address bar currently cannot be moved below the classic shell explorer toolbar.<br /><br />The address bar used to be always below the buttons in the explorer windows in windows 95 to windows xp.<br />This would provide more of a classic explorer feel. This is one of those things that you could say 'don't fix what isn't broken' and microsoft broke it. So this would be an amazing addition to classic shell.<br /><br />c) They do the same thing, yes. But that's not the point, what is though is that it'd be nice to have the address bar below the classic shell buttons like they were in windows 95 to windows xp.<br /><br />3. a) I recently found out that .ico's actually support custom resolutions such as 90 x 10 px, without having to use a square background such as 16 x 16, 32x32, and 256 x 256. I asked the forum sevenforums, and they said there that only square sizes were supported, however on another forum I found proof that custom resolutions were possible.<br /><br />b) I'm pretty sure that classic shell doesn't support .ico's on the toolbar to be different sizes. Such as a 32 x 32 px icon, and a 64 x 64 px icon on the same toolbar.<br /><br />This is where images would come in handy, since it would allow this behavior.<br /><br />c) If the icons were all the same size, yet the images were not, say the icons were all 64 x 64 px, and some of them would be 50 x 50 px inside the icon, and some of them were 24 x 24 px inside the icon, wouldn't you have unnessessary transparent space around the images, when you only wanted exactly 50 x 50 px, and 24 x 24 px? Images would allow you to have the exact dimensions that you'd like, without any transparent border, and would support different sized images on the same toolbar.<br /><br />d) Support for animated .gif's, animated .png, and a .bmp film strip such as with the start button which can be animated by scrolling through the stacked images. Images would be useful for this as well.<br /><br />.ico's just can't do this as far as I know.<br /><br /><br />What I'm proposing has its usability, productivity &amp; value-added benefits for the user too. Which isn't possible currently with classic shell. My idea is towards the users favor, total &amp; full customization with the classic shell explorer would be an added benefit to the classic shell experience which would benefit many.<br /><br />Anything else, just ask &amp; I'll try to answer as best I can. Thanks.

Is there anything else? You didn't seem to reply to everything. Thanks mate. =) <br /><br /><br />Is it true Ivo that you are technically limited as to what you can do as Gaurav said? Also see my other post I posted Dec the 31st, thanks, its much appreciated. ^^~<br /><br />I would say that a new toolbar with the address bar would be possible though as the one thing I'd take from all of this.<br /><br />My second, a menu bar on another separate toolbar I'd say would be possible, but now I'm not so sure after what Gaurav wrote about being technically limited by microsoft. <br /><br />Although, I'd still say that it'd be possible since it's possible to have a cut, copy , and paste button on the toolbar. Couldn't a menu bar with 'edit' and cut, copy , and paste be possible since buttons with those commands are possible? And Gaurav said that it's also possible to have text on a toolbar, with submenu's, so you could have a menu bar with 'edit' and cut copy and paste in there, as well as other options such as 'file' open, 'view' small icons ,large icons, details &amp; list.<br /><br />But, just an address bar Id say would be the most feasible thing to do. This would be the one thing that I'd take from my entire idea, it isn't asking for much, as compared to full customizeation of the classic explorer shell. Nothing has to be done, but maybe the address bar is do-able? I'm not sure, it's just an idea.<br /><br />With Anixx's program that disables the current address bar, I think we're a step closer to that. Which makes it easier by taking some work out of it as that part is done already.
