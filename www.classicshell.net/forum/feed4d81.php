I agree. The failings are limitations of the phpbb software that this forum uses. I don't think its silly search restrictions can be fixed. <strong>To search the forum, use Google or Bing.</strong><br /><br />&lt;enter search terms&gt; site:classicshell.net/forum<br /><br />e.g.1, if you don't know how to change Start button, <br /><br />In Google or Bing's search box, type: change start button site:classicshell.net/forum <br /><br />e.g. 2 if you want to know how to add some folder, let's say, 'Videos' to the Start menu, search like this:<br /><br />In Google or Bing's search box, type: add videos start menu site:classicshell.net/forum <br /><br />e.g. 3. If you want to search for Taskbar related topics, type: taskbar site:classicshell.net/forum in Google's search box.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sun May 18, 2014 9:17 pm</p><hr />

This forum has it.<br /><br />With anything dealing with technology, especially computers, there are a lot of three and four letter words, acronyms, and very relevant numbers. The problem is most forum software is set by default to completely ignore all numbers and all words of four letters or less and a list of &quot;common&quot; words.<br /><br />This forum for some reason is even set to ignore the word taskbar.<br /><br />Words such as taskbar, pin, start, menu, startmenu, shell and many other words a person might use when searching for information on Classic Shell should be specifically <em>included</em> by this forum's search index.<br /><br />If there's anything on here telling how to restore the ability in Windows 7 to &quot;pin to taskbar&quot;, it's 100% un-findable with the forum's search because it says taskbar is a &quot;common&quot; word and it ignores the other two as well. Taskbar should be in the index in ALL forums for anything to do with Windows.<br /><br />When going about the task of setting up a forum for a specific thing, the <strong>first</strong> thing one should do, before even starting to think about which software to use, is compile a list of relevant words that must be included in the search index.<br /><br />For a TV show that should include a list of all the characters' and actors' names, props that are important, locations, any unusual words of dialog and more.<br /><br />Doing so can reduce the number of repeat questions due to it being impossible to find the subject by searching. A FAQ isn't as good because many don't read it and if topical words are excluded from being indexed <em>searching won't find the answer in the FAQ</em>.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3768">Galane</a> — Sun May 18, 2014 1:58 pm</p><hr />
