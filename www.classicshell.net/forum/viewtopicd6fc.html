It appeared after I had one of my explorer hangs on login which I manually recovered from (ctrl+alt+del, task manager, restart explorer.exe) instead of letting time out.<br /><br />I updated to it from 4.3.0 after I posted on August 31st. I upgraded to Windows 10 with 4.0.1 installed which I upgraded to 4.3.0 right after. (just mentioning it for chain of events for possible troubleshooting)<br /><br />There are clearly some compatibility issues/bugs left, as evident by my issue and a couple other people reporting more.<br /><br /><br /><br />While it's great that classic shell was finally updated for the AU/CU, the sad part is that the &quot;fall&quot; creator's update is coming soon, which may break more things yet again.

I have seen people mentioning the issue of it not updating properly after upgrading the system before though in previous versions. So it's possible you might have needed to uninstall Classic Shell before upgrading to prevent that issue. Have you tried simply running a system reset to get your OS completely default [basically removing all things that don't come with Windows] and then reinstalling Classic Shell? If you can't uninstall the leftovers from it then that may be your best option.<br /><br />It's a pain but if you go into the settings app, and use the reset option you should be able to restore it to default version of FCU removing all files that don't come with it. Then you should be able to reinstall Classic Shell 4.3.1 and it should work flawlessly then.

I can't go around and change it on all working stations.<br /><br />Is there any solution how it can be fixed automatically?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Mabel
