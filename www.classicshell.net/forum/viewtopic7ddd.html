But I am wondering if this is enough to get the Settings panel translated ? I saw the ini file L10 are already french transalted. I have translated the README FILE and the EULA FILE to FRENCH TOO.<br /><br />I have been looking for an Fr_FR.Dll from my Classic shell installation directory but didnt find it... Is there one ? where is it ?<br />Or Do I have to make my own for having the settings panel translated ? Or the csv file is enought ?<br /><br />Thanks for answering,<br />Xenus98

Its the fr_FR translation of your en_US one.<br />You will not be able to tell if its better then the one you have... so you may not want to use it. Up to you.<br /><br />I will send you also the correct fr_FR.dll (corrected only the dialogs box) and you may decide to use it as is.<br /><br />Thanks for your great software. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Xenus

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The individual language files are often developed on separate schedule than the installer because they are done by volunteers in their spare time. That's why they are not included and need to be downloaded separately. You can download the files manually or from the Language tab in the settings.<br /><br />Currently there is no French installer. With your help I may make one.<br />For the DLL I would prefer to transfer the corrections myself. Some programs for editing DLLs may corrupt them. Please make me a list of all changes you want done.

I ve changed some french errors, some bad translations, and some controls size because labels were too smalls... If I tell you which dialogs were edited, cant you just copy the script text of it ? Or do I need to do you a list of modifications ?<br /><br />Its late for me now, will see that tomorrow but you can leave me detailled instructions on what you want me to do...

And thinking that the &quot;Check for update&quot; button is just for checking for an update and not for downloading a missing dll.... <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />((<br /><br />Its not clear at all for the end user. I think this panel should be redesigned to add 2 buttons may be. One for downloading the correct dll (and may be to automatically install it) and one for checking for updates that is a different thing...<br /><br />Finally i did download it by myself from the website and did create by myself the ProgramData\ClassicShell\Languages directory.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />Xenus
