		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey, first up, thanks for Classic Start Menu. It's fabulous!<br /><br />We having been running it from an early date with much success, but recently i've noticed delays in the start menu popping up. Sometimes as much as 30 seconds from clicking.<br /><br />Whilst i suspect it's a network issue rather than a bug in classic start menu, i don't know how to troubleshoot the dmp files generated by procdump.<br /><br />Would someone be able to either take a look or give me some guidance to take a look myself? (I tried opening in VS Express, but that just lists DLL's).<br /><br />I uploaded the zip file to your mediafire location with a name starting &quot;bodger&quot;.<br /><br />Environment is:<br />Classic Start Menu 4.3.0<br />Windows 10 Edu x64 (v1607)<br />Network installation with multiple DC's, DNS etc.<br /><br />We have done some server work recently, so i'm hoping it's some reference to an old dc (as i saw in another post), but i can't work out how to get more info out of the dmp files!<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Matt

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The slowdown seems to be caused by the file C:\Program Files (x86)\NSL\NSCommonHook64.dll.<br />It is probably trying to access a network location and waiting for a response.<br />Possibly related to the user profile being on a remote machine.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hey Ivo,<br /><br />Thanks for the response and appologies for taking a while to come back. The DLL in question is part of a management suite called NetSupport which was a reasonable candidate for causing the slowdown, but i've since taken it off my machine (a different PC to the one i used in the last test) and i'm still getting a noticeable pause when loading Classic Start Menu.<br /><br />The pause is not experienced when loading the regular start menu (via shift / start).<br /><br /><br />Appdata is based on server, but LocalAppdata is not redirected (and remains local)... Network is enterprise level with 10Gbps between switches and 1Gbps. It normally servers 500+ simultaneous users, but today, just about 30 as it's a training day, so high spec, low use.<br /><br />Any further advice with the new logs available here?<br />New logs: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5lh199lkkqoM2lrUV9UTWF0R1k">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5lh1 ... V9UTWF0R1k</a><!-- m --><br />The start menu click was between logfile 1 and 2 (possibly 3).<br /><br /><br />Thanks again for your time here, would love to get this nailed down!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Matt

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In this case the menu is trying to get the timestamp for a shortcut in the start menu to see if it has changed. That shortcut is probably on a remote machine.<br />See if disabling the settings &quot;Highlight newly installed programs&quot; makes a difference for you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks again for the advice on this Ivo.<br /><br />Rather than disable the &quot;Highlight newly installed programs&quot;, i figured i'd take the opportunity to do a bit of an audit. There were 6 or 7 old windows 8 shortcuts being distributed which no longer pointed to valid exe's (running from a mixture of local and server shares). <br /><br />Removing these appears to have solved it.<br /><br />Tested both machines and accounts from this thread and it appears to be much more responsive! (even with NetSupport running).<br /><br />Cheers very much for getting me on the right track!<br />Matt
