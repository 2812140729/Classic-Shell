RltkAPO64.dll v. 11.0.6000.568 is part of the driver.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Try running control.exe to open Control Panel and see if Explorer hangs or freezes. Realtek's driver, like IDT's driver is known to ship with a driver file that causes Explorer crashes when Control Panel is opened on Windows 10's newer releases.<br /><br />Also, try renaming the extension of the file, RltkAPO64.dll to RltkAPO64.old temporarily and install Classic Shell. See if the problem comes back. Classic Shell, when it loads the Start menu, caches the contents of the Control Panel. That may cause an immediate crash/freeze.

This does not have the RealTek HD Audio sound card.<br /><br />100% same experience: After Classic Shell was installed Windows became unresponsive after approx 30 minutes.<br /><br />As soon as explorer.exe was restarted things went back to normal.<br /><br />I forgot to check the thread count before restarting the process. After restarting thread count for explorer.exe was 87 up to 106 when playing around in Explorer/Control panel etc.<br /><br />Seems like a glitch with build 1607 and Classic Shell.
