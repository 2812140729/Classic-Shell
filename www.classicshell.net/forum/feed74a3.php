FYI, updated that older lady's new HP PC to v1803 on 5/15/2018 and Classic Shell worked fine afterwards. So yesterday I updated this desktop computer of mine and it too worked when it finished. <br /><br />I guess we've &quot;dodged the bullet&quot; until the fall 2018 upgrade is released later this year. <br /><br />Thanks again for Classic Shell!!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32416">Lone_Gunman</a> — Thu May 24, 2018 6:56 am</p><hr />

Opened this account just now to say.........................THANK YOU FOR CLASSIC SHELL!!!! <br /><br />I first found out about this software when I decided to register in the Windowz Insider program as a beta tester in the summer of 2015. After doing a clean install on this system and seeing what the start menu looked like I went hunting for something to &quot;fix&quot; it.  Classic Shell showed up in google search and the rest is history. I've run Classic Shell on EVERY beta version that I installed and when Win 10 went RTM in July of 2016 and I got my FREE copies for TWO desktops that I had beta versions on. Those two desktops plus a Toshiba laptop with Win 10 ALL HAVE CLASSIC SHELL DESKTOP ON THEM TO THIS DAY!!<br /><br />I see now that v1803 is listed so I guess I'll have to upgrade yet again??????? When/if Classic Shell stops working then that is when I'll stop using 10 at all. Two of my desktops are multi boot systems with various Windowz versions on each from XP on plus each also runs Linux Mint, which is my &quot;every day&quot; operating system that I use explicitly for secure online stuff. My Toshiba laptop has Win 10 on one hard drive and Linux Mint on another and I switch them depending on what I want/need to do with it. <br /><br />Ennywho, thanks again for creating Classic Shell and lets hope that someone will bake up the cause and continue to make it work with Windows JUNK!! In fact, I've got a new HP desktop coming tomorrow that I've got to get ready for the 84 year old lady and installing Classic Shell will be the FIRST thing I do to it after it boots up!!<br /><br />PS, I'm going to bookmark this page and check back occasionally to see if anyone is going to continue development on this.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32416">Lone_Gunman</a> — Sat May 12, 2018 7:12 am</p><hr />

Just curious, where can I go to find information regarding possible continuation of Classic Start Menu by another organization  - I think some are looking into it presently, but not sure how to find plans or progress of such actions.  I know there are many like myself who would like to encourage and support a continuation group but it seems to be a matter of getting people organized and in contact with one another.  Appreciate any information in this - thanks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2454">JohnBurns</a> — Thu May 03, 2018 8:43 am</p><hr />

Just wanted to say thank you.<br /><br />My first experience with win10 (i came from 3.1 &gt; 95 &gt; 98 &gt; ME &gt; 2k &gt; XP &gt; 7) was terrible. OMG, everthing was black, so depressing. The startmenue was so confusing. What is all this wierd chessboard-icons stuff about? There was no logic to me in that menue. It kinda made the OS worse like unity for ubtuntu. Absolutely disturbing.<br /><br />Classic shell is a great non commercial option. It is not as buggy as most spooky or OS destroying gui-software and it is much smaller in megabytes.  At first it was very confusing. So many options, switches. It took me serveral hours until i found my favourite style but the forum always answered all questions i had ... because someone else already asked them and they were kindly answered... thats how the internet should work all the time <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />. And its great that there is a save2file option for the startmenue and the explorer settings. I reinstall Win10 twice a year (feels like a fresh new haircut ^^ ... for the aerodynamics xD) and this save files makes it so much easier for me.<br /><br />Thanks to the developer and thanks for making it open source. I hope somebody will continue developing this awesome program. Thanks to the community.<br /><br />Because of you i now like Win10 more than Win7.<br />(Win7 was my favourtie OS with default settings + little changes the OS allowed me to do without additional software)<br /><br />Finally a DX12 Windows + beautiful GUI<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32329">Nico</a> — Tue Apr 24, 2018 10:16 am</p><hr />

Registered solely to say thanks, and you have been valuable to the windows community.<br /><br />Personally I run windows 8.1, I disagree with the principle of treating home users like beta testers on the twice yearly feature updates, one of the reasons been it breaks software such as classic shell.  I believe in been control of my own system, even if it means I am less secure, so be it.<br /><br />I use startisback for my menu but only because I already had a license when I realised classicshell does the same thing, on my family pc's they have classic shell for the menu, I use classic shell to enhance my explorer and IE tho.<br /><br />I perfectly understand why you quit, I imagine for something you do as a hobby, having to fix it every 6 months made it seem more like a job, which is what I feared would be the result after microsoft released windows 10.  The author of another bit of software I use also recently quit as well, I expect for similar reasons. I also wouldnt rule out microsoft deliberately breaking your program as well, I cannot remember the windows 10 start menu really changing on every update yet they seem to change code that forces you to have to fix it.<br /><br />I also commend you releasing the source code, been open to the community to carrying on your work, I like that integrity whilst other developers can react differently, pulling download links etc.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=32218">Chrysalis</a> — Mon Apr 02, 2018 2:44 am</p><hr />
