Every program can choose to use the new or the old style of common dialogs. I don't see a way to override that.<br /><br />BTW, I don't think 1366x768 is designed to work with 150% DPI. That reduces the effective resolution to 900x512. Even the very early versions of Windows required at least 800x600 resolution. Anything less than that you are asking for trouble.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Tue Apr 16, 2013 8:53 am</p><hr />

<title type="html"><![CDATA[Common Dialogs]]></title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=533&amp;p=2765#p2765"><![CDATA[
First I want to give you my best compliments!<br />After few days in using Windows 7 I wanted to go back to XP Pro forgetting the extra 5GB of my new laptop for the sake of usability. Fortunately I've found Classic Shell!<br /><br />People at Microsoft are insane. Should we put electric wires in their brains to let them understanding the simple concept that Shell and File Manager CAN NOT BE WEB PAGES?<br /><br />Anyway, Classic Shell allows me to try this new &quot;evolution&quot; called Windows 7, but a shock comes every time a Common Dialog pops out. They are ugly and dysfunctional. If you try changing screen DPI to 125% or 150% (quite common need in ultraportable laptop with 1366x768 resolution shown on 12&quot; lcd panel, isn't it?) the Common Dialogs become unusable: bottom buttons disapper, files panel disappear! Yes, we have a modern interface full of colours, transparencies, animations, ego-mations but we don't have buttons. Evolution!<br /><br />Yes, I've already read FAQ where you explain all the difficulties about tweaking Common Dialogs, but just to inform you about a possible solution (warning: I don't know the &quot;internals&quot; of Windows, so it could be a stupid suggestion). I've some old software like TextPad 4.7.3 (yes I have white hairs), who shows the old and confortable, almost romantic, Common Dialogs even in Windows 7. They sport the configurable left-side panel containing quick links, and the right panel where everything is in place (re-volution?). I guess those software call the CommonDialogs in a standard old-times fashion and Windows7 uses a kind of callback hook to the old DLL. The question: is it possible to force this kind of beaviour on all calls to Common Dialogs?<br /><br />bye bye and thanx again<br />Codex<br /><br />(Lenovo x220, Windows 7 64bit, a lot of patience)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=598">codexmundi</a> — Mon Apr 15, 2013 9:33 am</p><hr />
