		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After I Installed the windows 10 anniversary update I noticed it had uninstalled Classic Shell and had an even worse start menu as before. So I went to the site, checked if the latest version 4.3 supported the update and downloaded it.<br /><br /><br />When I installed it said it couldn't be trusted, I installed anyway but it did nothing. When I restarted my laptop it went straight to BIOS. Luckily I had a System Repair Disc close by and I could fix Windows.<br /><br />But now I still don't have Classic Shell and I don't want to risk it until I'm sure it will work. I hope I get an answer soon, because I really hate how windows is designing everything atm. It seems to get worse every update they do.

The official Classic Shell installer has a signature for &quot;Ivaylo Beltchev&quot;, and the fake one doesn't even have a signature.

Hopefully not many people got affected. Certainly if you used the built-in Classic Shell updater you would get a clean copy. Not only does it download from another location (that wasn't compromised), but it also validates the signature of the download before letting you run it.

I just tested the infected file on a sacrificial system with both &quot;UEFI&quot; and &quot;Legacy boot&quot; options in the BIOS. Presuming most new systems use EFI, infection would be rather limited as a whole.

Your Master Boot Record and Partition has been messed with by the infection. You can try to repair it, as suggested by <strong>ayyyylmao</strong>.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just registered to the forum to let you know I was hit by a malware installer as well. I downloaded a compromised classic shell installer from the classic shell main page about 2 hours ago after I installed the anniversary update of Windows 10. As far as I remember, it was from fosshub. My system went down and left a seemingly empty hard disk. No message was displayed, it just booted into the bios and no boot device was available.<br /><br />Fortunately, no damage was done, because I made a system image backup right before the Windows update, so I just restored the system drive and my machine was up again. I revisited the classic shell download page and redownloaded the installer, it was different from the bogus installer and signed as well, which was not the case with the bogus installer.<br />The problem with signed installers is: many software developers don't sign, so you install even if Windows warns you. Even if someone signs and then stops signing, it may be that he forgot about it. But you want to install NOW, so you skip the warning.<br /><br />What a waste of time. Simply a waste of time.

You gotta &quot;burn&quot; it into the USB dongle (ISO is like a copy of a CD for you to burn it and use it as an original CD).<br /><br /><br />You can use a program like ROSA Image Writer do burn it to an USB drive, and then format the driver after you are done fixing it all. ROSA Image Writer is free and safe.

This means that if it successfully installed, it was before they hacked/replaced the file. If it failed; it downloaded but did not run the infected file. (I can confirm because I JUST tried)  So you should be safe.
