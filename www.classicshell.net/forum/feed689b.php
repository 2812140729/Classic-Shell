aside from the spyware, and the spam (very big issues that should not be present in an operating system that you pay for), windows 10 is quite nice, and it is fun to see how its evolving. (this can be a problem at times, when various tweaks you make get reverted, or removed. and cant be re-applied, but its still worth it IMO)<br /><br /><br /><br />According to certain sources, about 1/3 of all windows 10 users use cortana regularly.. maybe they did something right here, (if she didn't require most of the previously mentioned spyware to run)<br /><br /><br />The app store is meh, and even microsoft agrees that its adoption is sub-par. Though this absolutely has potential (look at steam, every pc gamer uses it)<br />It would be useful if:<br />It could work with all programs, not just apps. (everyone already has programs they love, and a method (internet) to find them. If microsoft wants a migration, they need to offer an incentive to do so.<br />Storing all your programs settings (so they can sync across devices, and are not lost upon reinstall) would absolutely be a good start. 'Legacy' programs shouldn't reinstall on their own; but instead pop up in the notification tray prompting for install.<br /><br />I love task view, and the multiple desktops feature baked into windows 10. along with the improvements it has made to multi-monitor taskbars.<br />The notification area is a good idea, but poorly implemented (particularly because of spam)<br />The settings page is an oddity, though it seems more functional than the control panel of old (yes you still need the control panel, and they should make it more accessible, but its nice to have most of the common things on their own page)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Wed May 10, 2017 12:01 pm</p><hr />

Millennium edition- Someone from work gave me a free update cd. The only problem I remember, was some software would not install.<br />I went back to Win98. Not knowing at the time, ME had good stuff under the hood, like a restore feature.<br /><br /><br />I plum forgot about an evil operating system, worse than everything else, including Win10. <br />The name - Vista. Shop owners told me don't buy, because of driver problems. I never bought license for myself.<br />I did buy a complete HP Vista system for a relative, as a gift. Many problems, thereafter.<br />In the end, I put Win7 on system for her. Worked great. No bugs, no driver issues, and was easier on ram memory. <br />Progress shifts. She switched to Win7 laptop, and now smart phones are her primary operating systems.<br /><br /><br />In my eyes, the Vista visuals were better than Win7.<br />Hey, remember the fun times. <br />We would install Vista lookalike theme on XP to look cool. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Wed May 10, 2017 4:21 am</p><hr />
