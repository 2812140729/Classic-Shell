Or there may be workarounds such as renaming the installer but obviously Microsoft thinks there are some compatibility issues, why else would they block it?

There are workarounds for installing Classic Shell 4.1.0 such as renaming the installer but obviously there are some compatibility issues <em>according to Microsoft</em>.<br /><br />At the moment, Windows 10 is changing too much, as such it doesn't make sense to look into making Classic Shell compatible because it might break repeatedly.<br /><br />Update: Version 4.2.x of Classic Shell improves the support for Windows 10 but the OS is still changing.<br /><br />Please be patient and avoid creating new posts in the forum if possible asking about Windows 10 compatibility.

A small pop-up that allows you to choose a wireless connection.<br />Ideally the removal of all Metro styling woud be what I want to be able to achieve.<br /><br />I haven't used Classic Shell since Windows 8 first came out, and once I got entirely sick of it I reverted to Windows 7, so I am not sure of the features that are currently present in Classic Shell.

With a previous build of Windows 10 Technical preview, as you already know, ClassicShell worked, except that replacing the start button made some icons dissapear. If one disables it, the icons appear properly and everything else works as usually. Recenty Windows 10 upgraded to last build (unfortunatelly without asking...) and since ClassicShell doesn't work Yes, renaming the installer installs, but ony the classic start menu works and that not always! The classic explorer and IE plugin don't work. I uninstalled it, it was no use having it. Please do make a Windows 10 compatible version. How different will the final version be (compatibility-wise) from the last build? I also noticed that the default folder icon on last build is not that nice. It would be great if we could return it to Windows 7 or a custom version. <br />  <br />Thanks

They used to overlap with the rest of the taskbar.<br />Also the new version uses the task scheduler instead of the Run registry key, which doesn't work well under Windows 10 (possibly a bug).<br /><br />Edit: The latest version has reverted to using the Run key again.

So perhaps a future CS version could offer a fix for that. <br /><br />I have posted the link to Classic Shell many times for Windows users, and hope to be able to continue to use it with W/10.
