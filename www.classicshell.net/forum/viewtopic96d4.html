		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Would it be possible to implement more than just the 3 tint colors in a start menu skin? I know that the 3 color limitation is because the masks are based on RGB colors, but I was wondering if there could be any ways around this. If there's not, I do have an idea/suggestion for Ivo that could allow people to use multiple mask bitmaps. Here's what I'm thinking:<br /><br />Let's say this is my main start menu bitmap.<br /><img src="download/fileef0b.php?id=1634" alt="" /><br />(Not actually mine, credit goes to JoshD)<br /><br />Now let's say I wanted to have the bitmap follow system colors. So the skin's scripting could look something like this:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">Main_bitmap_mask1=101<br />Main_bitmap_mask2=102<br /><br />Main_bitmap_tint1=$System3DDKShadow<br />Main_bitmap_tint2=$SystemBtnShadow<br />Main_bitmap_tint3=$SystemBtnHighlight<br />Main_bitmap_tint4=$System3DLight<br />Main_bitmap_tint5=$SystemBtnHighlight<br /></div><br /><br /><br />And the masks could look like this:<br /><img src="../../i.imgur.com/dKOI8bT.png" alt="" /><br /><br /><img src="../../i.imgur.com/fIZMJMC.png" alt="" /><br />Black would represent where the colors are defined by the other mask bitmap, or areas that would be otherwise ignored (if black on both masks). I'm not sure how something like this would effect performance, or how difficult this would be to implement. Maybe it would be best to not allow colors to overlap each other on the separate masks. Just a thought.<br /><br />Please let me know what you think, or if you otherwise have any other ideas for using more than just 3 mask colors. Thanks in advance.

By default the patterns cover the entire menu unless<br />; a pattern mask is specified. The Red, Green, Blue and Alpha channels of the mask determine where on the main menu the patterns will show.<br />; For Classic styles there is only one mask Main_pattern_mask. For Windows 7 styles there are additional masks Main_pattern_search_mask, Main_pattern_jump_mask,<br />; Search_pattern_mask, Search_pattern_search_mask and Search_pattern_jump_mask<br /><br />; Emblems - The emblems are additional images that are drawn on top of the main menu without any stretching. You can have up to 10 separate emblems.<br />; Each emblem has an bitmap, padding and alignment. The padding specifies how many pixels to leave on each side of the emblem. The alignment specifies how to<br />; align the image relative to the menu. The horizontal alignment can be left, left1, left2, right, right1, right2, center, center1, center2 or corner.<br />; The vertical alignment can be top, bottom, center or corner.<br />; Emblems can have a mask similar to the patterns, which will restrict where on the menu the emblem will show. The Classic style only needs one mask Main_emblem_mask.<br />; For Windows 7 styles there are additional masks Main_emblem_search_mask, Main_emblem_jump_mask, Search_emblem_mask, Search_emblem_search_mask and Search_emblem_jump_mask<br />; Only the first 4 emblems are affected by the mask. The other 6 will be drawn in full.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Message from Ivo on XP Classic Retro<br /><br />Sure, but with the tint system you can use a single bitmap+mask and have 3 separate color areas. The colors can be set via the tints. You can have as many variations as you want without adding bitmaps.<br /><br />In the simplest case you can even replace the bitmap with a solid color, so all you need is a single mask bitmap. Let's say you have a mask that is square with 4 quadrants - black, red, green, and blue. You can control what color goes into each quadrant:<br />Main_bitmap_mask=11 - the mask bitmap<br />Main_bitmap=#123456 - first color (goes into the black areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint1=#56789A - second color (goes into the red areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint2=#ABCDEF - third color (goes into the green areas of the mask)<br />Main_bitmap_tint3=#FEDCBA - fourth color (goes into the blue areas of the mask)<br /><br />The alpha channel of the mask bitmap can be used to provide transparency.<br /><br />Take a look at the Metro skin. It makes heavy use of this trick to combine the Windows colors into multiple shapes.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'exact blend ratio'. If I'm understanding you correctly, Windows doesn't 'blend' colors (well not with the classic theme at least) but all of the system colors are stored in the registry and are completely changeable. It doesn't darken or brighten the color based on the ButtonFace color for borders, but rather it has unique border colors. Go to the Start Menu Skinning Tutorial page and check the System Colors section for a complete list of colors. I hope I'm understanding you correctly.<br /><br />Anyway, the pattern method works great. Thanks for your help! Take a look at your <a href="viewtopicb05b.html?f=17&amp;t=3131&amp;p=28838#p28838" class="postlink">XP Classic Retro thread</a> to see what I've been able to do with this.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi <strong>R.O.B.</strong><br />Looking good.<br />I thought skin is not going to work in Win 7, due to the $ sign for metro colors?<br />Works great on Win7, with the Windows Classic color adjustments. <br />Similar to the way &quot;Classic skin&quot; works, but with adjustable gradient.<br />Does that mean if you put the Win7 name for text color, that can be variable as well?<br /><br /><br />In Win10, gradient is just one soft blue color. <br />I'm sure you have that special hack way, to turn on the 3d border and colors.<br /><br /><br />I think what I was blabbering about was:<br /><br />For Win 10 without any hack, having 3d borders built into skin.<br />Looking at picture of your skin on Win7,<br />the menu picked color is mixed with white to get two different ratios for the lighter shades of that color. <br />If that ratio/percentage is known, then possibly just one tint color mask, <br />could be used with those three intensities built in, <br />along with a white tint as background, to mix it to proper proportion.<br />And Ivo's custom color picker built into skin option could be used instead.<br /><br />Well that was the way I was thinking, that could drastically reduce overall skin size. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Yeah, that's kind of what I thought you were saying. Like I said, all of the border colors are unique and can be defined in the registry; it is possible to switch the dark/light colors. The only time Windows itself 'blends' colors is when the ButtonFace color is changed in the Advanced Appearance settings, and even then it writes those new colors to the registry. But by using patterns, it would totally be possible to have 3D borders with visual styles enabled. You'd just have to be smart about the masking bitmaps.

Actually, if you look at the mask examples on the first post in this thread, those could actually be usable for just this. Just make one of them a main bitmap mask, and the other one a pattern mask, and you've got 3D borders that will change with your system. I'll try it out when I've got the time.

I used Ivo's icon frames, without a gap in between.<br />I cant make it work in sytem variation though. Don't know what it references to.<br /><br />Do you happen to know what $ ??????text <br />to use in your variation?

The Classic Theme was never removed, and all it takes is one tiny 3rd-party tool to re-enable it. Said tool doesn't even need to kill DWM to do so! Problem is, half the shell has no idea what to do with it and just falls apart in some way or another .-.
