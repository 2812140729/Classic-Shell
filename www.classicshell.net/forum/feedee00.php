4 things..<br />firstly thats onboard graphics(its on the processor).. so IF you did screw it up badly; the processor itself breaks (which means the computer itself becomes non-functional) <br /><br />Secondly overclocking generally only slightly increases FPS (maybe a 25% gain if your lucky) So it might be worth overclocking if you are getting 20fps on the lowest settings in a particular game. (because it will bring it up to 25-30, which is a notable improvement). If you are receiving 40+fps, or dont have a specific game that needs that boost. Its hardly worth it<br /><br />thirdly, IF you have a desktop, you should really consider a dedicated graphics card. for 80-100$ you can get something that preforms 10x better than what you have (and its fairly safe to install, though we probably want something low power..<br /><br />4thly, if its a laptop (or upgrading isnt an option) make sure to follow the guides.. which will involve small increments, followed by stress test, followed by small increments (expect to spend 2-3 hours on this)<br /><br /><br />If its a desktop, and you want to upgrade, Ill need a bit more INFO to continue.. (because adding a physical card is actually quite easy, safer, and you will see tangible improvements)<br />Otherwise, I cant recommend it, unless you are willing to devote hours into reading up, and making it work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sun Mar 12, 2017 6:47 am</p><hr />

Is it okay to overclock my graphics card? I'd want to, but I'm worried that I might break my computer.<br />Graphics card: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10096">NoahNicholsFourm</a> — Sun Mar 12, 2017 3:27 am</p><hr />
