		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, when I first began using classic shell, it wasnt set to start by itself, and i created a shortcut to the launcher, and would double-click it to begin with<br /><br />since its portable, i think just double-clicking ClassicStartMenu.exe every time we plug in the USB would work great, since we're only going to use it for a few hours, and nothing will be saved or transferred to that computer<br /><br />it would have to be a completely separate set-up to what we use on our own computers, for instance, we'd have to use portable Search Engines instead of Agent Ransack, and our  folders etc woulnt be there... etc..<br /><br />but here's some thoughts:<br /><br />- if Portable Classic Shell could have a %dir% or something that we could use to automatically reference folders inside Classic Shells own install directory, our Menu could have custom folders<br /><br />- the same thing to get to our Bats &amp; vbs, etc<br /><br />- And have a Bat file which automatically does a DOS transfer of all files in a specific internal folder to the System Drive, such as shellexecute, devcom, makelink, nircmd, etc <br /><br />- contain all of its own shortcuts internally, for items in the internal directory, or in the same DRIVE as the Classic Shell, but in say a &quot;Program Files&quot; folder<br /><br />- retain all of our custom DOS commands, and locations<br /><br />- the ability to have multiple versions, one for Windows XP, one for Win7/8 etc, in case commands or Control Panel directories are different etc.. <br /><br />just some thoughts

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />ya, but alot of people have to use alot of computers overly-administrated by some IT power-crazed lunatic, or Ghost image OS's with all drives Ghosted, and alot are older systems, cant support Win7, and their Bios is either locked or not worth tinkering with.. Probably dont often need a whole OS, just all your portable apps that the administrator wont let you install.. If i need an OS, i just use Windows PE  or something.. anyway, u'd have to carry around WinXP &amp; Win7, and have access to Bios... not usually worth the trouble,.. especially if you just want to use Firefox with a new Flash player, and few basic tools or something.. <br /><br />theres nothing wrong with their OS, really, just want to run portable apps<br /><br />although, where possible, itd be great to have your own Win7 with all the favorite installs on a microSD phone card... but most often it wont work, depending on where you're at

I think VB does that pretty easily.. does the current classic shell support relative paths in the Links? <br /><br />anyway, it might work like this:<br /><ul><li>Create a NewButton</li><li>Add a Relative Link.. if you browse to an Item on a computers D, E, F drive etc, a window pops up and tells you that it is not located on the same drive as Classic Shell Portable (CSP), and cannot be added</li><li>Adding any program on the System Drive would work (C:\ only), without the need to type the drive path, as it does now, anyway</li><li>You could then create custom links to:<ul><li>Folders anywhere on your USB drive</li><li>Any Portable Programs</li><li>Links to Bat files contained in a folder on the USB drive</li><li>Links to any Program Installed on your USB Drive, that didnt need to make any Registry Entries, etc..</li><li>Commands to Nircmd, or other custom Command Programs</li><li>System Commands</li><li>Anything on the System Drive (C:\ only)</li></ul></li><li>All Icons would have to be either on the System Drive, or in a Folder anywhere on your USB drive</li><li>Start Menu Buttons would be customizable</li><li>Search would use AgentRansack installed on your USB drive, and Parameters maybe could even be Relative to USB search, &amp; to Windows Drive</li><li>Internet Search would launch a USB Browser</li><li>Recent Apps would only save Items launched from the same drive as CSP is installed, and on the System Drive (C:\ only)</li><li>Pin to CSPM could work for only items on the CSP Install Drive as well</li></ul><div align="right">-</div>and that would be all thats needed.. with a few more considerations:<br /><br /><ul><li>It doesnt have to be &quot;Stand-Alone&quot; Portable, so long as it Installs on the USB and doesnt make changes to the System Drive or Registry</li><li>If its not possible to simply click ClassicShellPortable.exe and have it work on Windows, then Classic Shell could have its own menu interface separate from Windows.. a bit like the portableapps.com one, only more open, free, customizable, &amp; useful..</li><li>It could dock to the left, right, top, bottom, or any of the 4 corners.. and be drag-resizable...</li><li>The Menu could be Multi-Column or Scrollable, and even include its own little quicklaunch on the bottom toolbar..</li></ul><div align="right">-</div>Classical Explorer Portable could perhaps just be a stand-alone Explorer Program.. like Q-dir.. or not, not important.. Classic Shell is all that needed

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, i think I may have solved the most difficult problem<br /><br />Theres a super killer little Program called <a href="http://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/" class="postlink">Windows CD Emulator</a><br /><br />it has x64 &amp; x86 versions, it's Installable-Portable, and has an option to disable Security Warnings<br /><br />there an Actually Portable Version they make but is quite a bit different.. i dont think it'll work for this, since it auto assigns drive letters..<br /><br />But I tested x64 version out on my Win7Ult64 on a limited User account, and it prompt for a password<br /><br />I right-clicked the program &gt; Compatibility &gt; Run this Program in Compatibility Mode for Windows Vista &gt; Apply<br /><br />and it worked on the limited user account, and successfully mounted an ISO to V:\<br /><br />I didnt see &quot;Compatibility Mode for Windows XP&quot; though... so i'll have to try it on an XP machine next week.. but thats totally awesome!

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />well, it worked on a very strictly administrated windows XP SP3 computer...<br /><br />I was able to mount, as a test, a Windows XP.ISO to a manually assigned S: Drive without a problem..<br /><br />SO.. I think I'm going to go ahead with a Self-Contained Master Folder Portable Install of Classic Shell &amp; See what I cant do to get it set up with all S:\ drive Links &amp; Locations. then select the Master folder and create a ISO Image with Folder2ISO, at that level, of the entire folder.. and put that on the drive<br /><br />Since I want to save space, most all programs and whatnot will be stored within a Master-Folder Hierarchy on my USB drive, and all the links will go through that folder's directory to their respective paths, with all Drive letters changed to S:\ or maybe U:\... as opposed to simply Enveloping them all into a single ISO folder.. <br /><br />this will hopefully allow for editing and moving things around and adding things to folders and so on..<br /><br />pretty excited so far..<br /><br />on a side note.. while I cant install normal programs on the computer due to restrictions, I was able to run the WinCDEmu.exe Installer.. then double-click the ISO.. since it assigns itself to ISO folder types.. the default on the computer was to open ISO with WinRAR... and I can seem to get WinCDEMu to open an ISO with &quot;Open With..&quot;.<br /><br />if anyone knows a way Im missing, let me know.. otherwise the little installer should work.. I dont think its an actual Installer more than it is an ISO Associator..

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've been thinking, a smaller Portable Classic Shell could even compliment a Normal Install of Classic Shell, and both could be run Simultaneously.<br /><br />If we could somehow get the Entire Shell to Float, or be Dockable to certain areas of the screen, then we could have it on the bottom left, or top left, or top right, or center, and it would work in conjunction with the Built-in Windows Start Menu, or a Start menu running the full version of Classic Shell<br /><br />Then the menu could contain native built-in commands, links to Built-in System Tools &amp; Programs, DOS Commands, Network Control, etc<br /><br />then just take it with us wherever we go. <br /><br />and secondary is linking to Portable Programs contained on the USB, as an additional effort, but not required for full use<br /><br />then we can keep our Full Classic Shell free of those programs, so we have space for other programs<br /><br />at least, it would be cool if you could find a way to run 2 start menus at a time, one of them can be moved anywhere, and each one can run independently of the other

I use my PC for music mostly, so it needs to be as lean as possible.<br /><br />Would you please consider changing the app over time to save settings in the apps folder, stop using the registry and maybe add the ability to register and unregister DLL's as needed? Perhaps it should simply do that on startup and shutdown of the app?<br /><br />Thanks
