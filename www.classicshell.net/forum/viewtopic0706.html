Unfortunately I have no idea what made the difference. The last thing I did directly related to this was attempt to make an exclusion for the install file in windows defender but that didn't work as far as I could tell as it does not show up in exclusions. Something definitely up with creators update to cause all this hassle!

After the update, the explorer continuously restarts. In the task manager (started via shortcut) I can see that ClassicShell is starting and explorer.exe restarts. After uninstalling ClasicShell, the PC runs as expected. Installing ClassicShell again leads to the restarting explorer. I have not seen the cause of this behavior.<br />Any suggestion where to look?<br /><br />Ciao, Mathias<br /><br />[Update]<br />The issue is caused by the IDT HD Audio driver that is part of the Windows Home edition and that is outdated (2010). Although historic, the driver is not flagged for update so I did it manually and voila: ClassicShell works and the PC is stable<br />[\Update]

I'm on the Creators Update btw.<br /><br />Update: So I seem to have this explorer loop crash problem as mentioned by other in this thread. Funny thing is though, it only happens in safe mode on my system.

This issue cannot be reliably reproduced so it's hard to fix. This is not specific to Creators Update.

The computer does *not* have IDT Audio.  I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times (restarting the computer in between) and also cleaning the registry with Wise Registry Cleaner, but no luck.

After tinkering around trying to fix the internet connection problem, I discovered that not all Microsoft services were starting up.  So I fixed that (leaving IDT Audio running) and restarted.  Back to the Classic Shell crash-reload cycle.  Tried restarting again with IDT set not to load, but still no joy.  Found a folder called IDT in the Program Files, and renamed it, but that didn't work either.  So how do I get rid of something that isn't listed as a driver or an app?  Or maybe it's something else entirely?

Trying to kill CS in the task manager didn't work so I uninstalled it again.<br />Is this alternating between normal windows start and CS what others are seeing?  If so, can you point me to the section on how to fix it?  I've uninstalled CS with iobit and then deep scan.  I've also ran ccleaner and rebooted, downloaded a fresh version of CS and reinstalled.

The system started &quot;flashing&quot; alternating between Win 10 start and CS. It was a bit difficult to stop. Trying to kill CS in the task manager didn't work so I uninstalled it again.<br />Is this alternating between normal windows start and CS what others are seeing? If so, can you point me to the section on how to fix it? I've uninstalled CS with iobit and then deep scan. I've also ran ccleaner and rebooted, downloaded a fresh version of CS and reinstalled. Same problem. Thanks in advance for any advice.</div><br /><br />Sounds like the problem I'm having.  Mine is still unresolved, but you may have more luck if your computer has IDT Audio (uninstall it).

I found this out because it caused the same problem when i tried to load Control Panel ... it just crashed the Control Panel and Explorer.<br /><br />So i am guessing that when CS loads it also tries to load all of the .cpl files to the start menu?<br /><br />Anyway i just deleted the file in question and all is well.

Sometimes if I change to desktop and back to the game the shell is unvisible, then again visible in the game. What can I do?</div><br /><br />I have noticed this exact same thing with the 1703 update (x64) and classic shell 4.3 but this time on my media centre which runs Kodi. I have Kodi set up so that it runs in what it terms a full screen window. When a video plays, the classic shell icon appears. Clicking on this brings up the start menu etc. and then clicking off the start menu gets rid of the start menu and classic shell icon unless the video is stopped and another started. I suspect it occurs the screen resolution changes.

If you let us know how we go about capturing a crashdump I will upload a few which will hopefully allow you to track down the cause.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Michael
