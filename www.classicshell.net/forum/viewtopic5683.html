		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Below is a picture of my Classic Shell 4.3.0 Start menu. Note the two entries &quot;Recent&quot; and Recent (2)&quot; on the jump list (yes, I made the same mistake twice in a row--nothing if not consistent). Since I up(?)graded from Win 7 to Win 10 earlier this week, my Office 2003 programs don't show any files listed under My Recent Documents when I want to open a file I've already worked on. I thought a direct link to the Recent file folder (at C:\Users\[account name]\Recent\) might help. Wrong! With these two &quot;Recent&quot; entries on the Start menu, left-click, right-click, and hover have the same effect: none at all. No context menu, no going to another folder or program, no nothing. Instead, the computer freezes for about 5 seconds, and then the taskbar is erased and rewritten. That's all.<br /><br />And I can't get rid of them. Usually, a right-click on a Start menu entry yields a context menu which includes &quot;Unpin from Start menu (Classic Shell),&quot; but as I said all I get from these bad boys is a rewritten taskbar. I uninstalled Classic Shell and then reinstalled it yesterday, and everything is right back where I left it. Usually that's good; this time, not so much. I've also tried going into the Win10 Personalization settings for Start and turning off &quot;Show most used apps&quot; and &quot;Show recently added apps,&quot; with no success. Is there any way to get these guys off my Classic Shell start menu? I have a feeling they may also be in the Windows 10 start folder, but I can't get in to see.<br /><br />Lenny<br /><br />PS - Last-minute update: After about 20 hours in existence, and 5 minutes after I typed the above, the problem has just gone away by itself! Suddenly the bad links did respond to right-clicks and I unpinned them both. I've done nothing to Classic Shell setup or Win 10 personalization since a couple of hours ago, but I thought I'd try one last time before posting, and Classic Shell had cured itself somehow. Good ol' Classic Shell--next stop, the Donate button. But I thought I'd post this anyway, if for no other reason than to give hope to anyone else who finds himself in a similar mess.
