I too have been experiencing the vanishing icons and specifically problems with Chrome. For me this happened when I was updated to the Creator's version of Windows 10. <br /><br />I found that in all but Chrome, if I pinned from the actual executable, I could get the program's icon to stick, but then I would get duplicate icons on the right side of the taskbar as I loaded the program. This is something I have reported in the Windows Community Forum, as I think it is related to Creator as the duplicate Icons as appear when in safe mode... i.e. not Classic Shell. The loss of the Chrome Icon occurs after a cold shutdown and subsequent reboot. I suspect that is also a Windows issue, though it might not be. It may be a difference in how Windows Interacts with Shell during the pinning process as per Creator.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=20688">MikeLieberman</a> — Thu Jun 08, 2017 7:04 pm</p><hr />

Hi,<br /><br />I tried for some days now, but things didn't change: It may be unlikely, but with classic shell installed in fact the pinned Chrome icon gets lost from the taskbar. For that, you don't even need a reboot -- logging out the user and logging in again is sufficient to let the icon vanish.<br /><br />Without classic shell, the pinned icon keeps being pinned as it should. When I re-install classic shell, the icon runs up and away again, sometimes immediately at the next booting, sometimes at the second one.<br /><br />Even extremely unlikely things love to happen quite fast...<br /><br />What can I do to help finding out possible reasons?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19816">njotha</a> — Sat May 13, 2017 12:04 pm</p><hr />

It is unlikely that Classic Shell would cause pinned icons to disappear from the taskbar. It doesn't do anything with the icons.<br />Is it possible it was just a coincidence that there was no problem while Classic Shell was not installed?<br />Try running uninstalled for a few days to confirm that.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Sat May 06, 2017 7:49 pm</p><hr />

O/S: Windows 10 Version 1703 Build 15063.138<br /><br />Classic Shell version 4.3.0 German<br /><br />No antivirus (except Windows Defender), no adblocker or similar apps installed<br /><br />Hardware: Intel NUC6i7kyk, 16 G Ram, 256 G m.2 ssd for O/S and software, 1 T ssd for data only<br /><br />Several efforts to help myself: cleaned/resetted icon cache etc including re-installing Win 10.<br /><br />Problem: With Classic Shell installed, some icons in taskbar get totally lost after rebooting, not even the famous &quot;white square&quot; remains:<br /><br />a) Google Chrome&#058; gets absolutely lost, even if you uninstall CS, reboot, add Chrome to the taskbar, reboot, re-install CS - after one to three reboots, Chrome again has vanished from the taskbar. As long as CS is not installed, the Chrome icon behaves normally in the taskbar.<br /><br />b) Office 2016: Icons get lost similarily to Chrome, but do so only if you move a link to Word/Excel etc to the taskbar (e.g. a link which you had at your desktop). It doesn't get lost any more when you open the office programme directory and pin the .exe directly to the taskbar.<br /><br />c) No problem with internal Windows apps / links resp., they behave normal in taskbar (Camera, &quot;This PC&quot;, &quot;Show Desktop&quot;, Edge, Calculator, Snipping tool etc.)<br /><br />I'd really like to have Chrome and others available at the taskbar again...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=19816">njotha</a> — Sat May 06, 2017 9:36 am</p><hr />
