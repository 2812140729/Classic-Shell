Hey all (but mainly Ivo).<br /><br />I'm wondering would it be possible, somehow, to replace the Explorer &quot;tree view&quot; component only?<br /><br />I ask because over the years it's become an absolute bloated mess:<br /><br /><ul><li>Too many top-level nodes (User folders, Favourites, OneDrive, HomeGroup, Network, Desktop folders, Creative Cloud if you have it)</li><li>New features with each Windows release (Favourites, Libraries, Quick Access)</li><li>A very different layout if &quot;Show all folders&quot; is checked</li><li>User folders showing under &quot;This PC&quot; along with the hard drives</li><li>Repetition of same user folders in multiple places (Top level, Quick Access, Favourites, Libraries, This PC)</li><li>Physical duplication of user folder items if you've previously updated their locations</li><li>Sudden appearance of user folders in the main tree if accessed from &quot;Quick Access&quot;</li><li>No real way to change features except through registry hacks</li><li>Etc., etc.</li></ul><br />It's just awful!<br /><br />Explorer as a bit of software is awesome, it's just really badly let down by the tree view. Each time they upgrade the OS, I go running to Google to find the latest registry hacks to remove all the junk from the tree so I can actually get some work done.<br /><br />What would be great would be a way to completely customize the tree, in the same way that we can customise Classic Start's start menu.<br /><br />The question is - is this actually possible? Explorer is my #1 go-to bit of software, and just as Classic Start has rescued the Start Menu, I'd love to see Explorer rescued as well.<br /><br />And before anyone says &quot;why not use an Explorer replacement?&quot; I've tried them all, and they're all pretty awful in their own way.<br /><br />Microsoft actually has a great bit of software with Explorer, they've just crucified the left hand column.<br /><br />Cheers for reading,<br /><br />Dave Stewart<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4261">davestewart</a> â€” Sun Oct 04, 2015 4:10 pm</p><hr />
