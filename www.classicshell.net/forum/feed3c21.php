Yes, if you are just going to get rid of Windows caption text with an image of text or picture,<br />then it's easy. A couple of us have actually put a fake caption picture on a classic 2 column menu.<br /><br />Other. There is a CSM caption setting that allows user to replace Windows caption with different text.<br /><br />At least try before giving up. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />From what I remember a while back, someone was super ticked off about not getting the skin the way they wanted.<br />Did not help that skin went corrupt. Dang it, what was name on it blue letters,,dark matter,,dark space,whatever.<br />I think it had text right in the top middle of classic 1 menu. It will distort.<br />The persons skin was called something like F@#this F*&amp;% skin. Well now that Ivo introduced emblems,<br />the text can be a non distorting emblem and look good.<br />So please try and see how far you can go.<br /><br />Edit: Ah. It was called Darkmatter Subspace<br />Maybe someone can take over it and finish it. It's probably still there, way back in the pages.<br />Looks like it came from The Skins Factory.<br />The text emblem would need to be a bit smaller to avoid being cut off on sides,<br />when menu shrinks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2016 10:05 am</p><hr />

Hi fonpaolo. <br /><br />If one looks at the start menu in the simplest way, it is one or two columns of information.<br />The rest of it is visual filler.<br /><br />Looking at your S.H.I.E.L.D. work, there are lots of extra visuals.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to a shrinking/expanding menu is there are just 4 safe areas on a single column menu,<br />and six on two column that one can have non stretching images. Ivo added a new emblem feature that can add, <br />I think up to ten emblems on classic style menu, and around 3 to 10 emblems on 7 style. <br />Classic has just one main menu, where as 7 style has three. <br />On 7 style, some emblems won't look good, or get in the way of the search, and jump list menus, <br />so they need a mask to hide them or show them. I think only 4 can be used with mask. <br />All the rest of emblems will show up on the other views. No, I take that back. On the last 7 style menu I made,<br />I did not have to make a mask for search view menu. I had screenshot of xp icons as emblem for main menu on 2nd column.<br />(can't have real icons 2nd column) I had to make a blocking mask to stop emblem showing on jump list view menu.<br />I did not need to for the search view menu. <br /><br />I think it would be best to start with a classic style skin, to learn the ropes. 7 style is more complicated.<br />Each style has advantages and disadvantages. There is one other thing. Emblems don't work on submenus.<br />The submenu safe corner spaces are only safe to a certain small submenu size. <br />I think it works like other shrinking/expanding elements. Once the expanding slices shrink to zero amount, the safe slices start to erode, and shrink down. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Could have been updated?<br />I am absolutely sure a selector will shrink away the safe slices areas. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As stated earlier, I don't know everything. Some of what I've said could be wrong. <br />Got the facts wrong, or because I do not understand how to use text logic properly. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Beats me on the thread question.<br />I do kind of wish there was a separate non locked thread for questions/answers on skinning.<br /><br />Till next time.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Thu Dec 29, 2016 8:07 am</p><hr />

Thanks juniper7.<br />2D and 3D graphics is part of my job and until a few years ago also my main hobby.<br />The images in my gallery are experiments: why not play with something I like?<br />Searching some new techniques, workflows, inspirations.<br />Some were good enough to be uploaded, most of them not. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br /><br />Going back to the topic, I use Start Menu Classic, and there's still room.<img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />The images you've seen is only a part of my desktop, there are many other skins, some are different, some are more complex.<br />I prefer not to show it, simply because they're too complicated to share, some are too specific, I can't find sources capable to cover all countries, I don't want to disappoint someone with a no and first of all, I have no time.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Jcee for the clarification, I was almost sure.<br /><br />Before to post something, especially if I'm new on a forum, I always read the rules, trying to find what is allowed or not.<br />It's an experience gained in years of frequentation, more or less constant, in several forums.<br />Many times I've been at your place.<img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I almost forgot why I'm here...<img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br />The more I read, the more I'm confused.<br />Given my very limited free time, I can't build something by trials and errors, at the present rate, it will take a decade!<br /><br />If here it's allowed* and there's someone who can help me build a Start Menu skin, as I hope, he's welcome.<br /><br />*for example in the Rainmeter forums you can ask for help, but not ask someone to do it for you.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=16365">fonpaolo</a> — Fri Nov 25, 2016 1:23 pm</p><hr />

links are just fine, as long as they pertain to classic shell in some way.. (IE requesting something that looks like something)<br />The only thing we really block is intentional spam (which is usually like 20 links in a single post whose body does not even form a coherent paragraph)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Thu Nov 24, 2016 7:53 pm</p><hr />
