The OS thinks the software is installed but the state is damaged so it can't uninstall it. There used to be software in the old days called TweakUI that was able to remove software from the install list without actually uninstalling any files. But I don't know if there's something that can work on Windows 8.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />First, before trying this, try to download the installer of the version you have installed and see if can be removed. If despite running the installer of the version of Classic Shell you have, it can't be uninstalled, then read ahead.This is a Windows Installer issue (system related). It can happen with any other software that uses Windows Installer, not just Classic Shell, nor something that is caused by Classic Shell, but due to the <em>installation system</em> it uses. <br /><br /><br />There used to be an unsupported tool by Microsoft for cleaning up partially uninstalled Windows Installer-based applications called Windows Installer Cleanup Utility. Download this tool from here (link is dead): <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com:443/MSI-cleanup-utility-3889c8db" class="postlink"><strike>http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/MSI-cleanup-utility-3889c8db/file/55314/1/msicuu2.exe</strike></a> but Softpedia has it at <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Windows-Installer-CleanUp-Utility.shtml" class="postlink">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Windows-Installer-CleanUp-Utility.shtml</a>, install it and open it. <strong>Note that you must install and run Windows Installer Cleanup Utility as administrator (with elevated rights). </strong>Be careful with the use of this tool. It should list all applications on your system which use Windows Installer including some version of Classic Shell. Select Classic Shell in that list (and make sure you don't select any other product) and click &quot;Remove&quot;. Let it remove and then click Exit. <br />Now try installing the latest version of Classic Shell and it should work. If no version of Classic Shell appears in Windows Installer Cleanup utility, exit the tool without doing anything and remove the tool from Programs and Features. <br /><br /><br />Also, note this tool is recommended only for your convenience. Classic Shell does not bear responsibility for Windows related issues or anything that may happen from the use of third party tools we recommend for troubleshooting.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Same irritating problem here fixed with the msi cleanup tool.<br />This tool however is no longer available at the link in the post above it has been removed by Microsoft.<br /><br />I found several places the tool is available and used this link at softpedia<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Windows-Installer-CleanUp-Utility.shtml">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/S ... lity.shtml</a><!-- m --><br />Because it is the least prone to misleading spam links and unwanted downloads - cnet is dire these days.<br /><br />That worked fine and allowed me to finally upgrade v3.6.2 to v3.8 after a lot of wasted time and aggravation - it also appears to go straight into Windows 8 64 (not the 8.1 version) without issue and run fine.<br /><br />As a matter of interest I am a system builder and a certified geek, I have recommended / pre / post installed Classic Start (with an exhortation to make a donation probably wasted but I tried) for 90% of my clients who are largely thrilled with classic start (if indeed they notice it - they sure as hell notice the start screen if I leave Win8 as standard). I have also had a number of frustrated and really angry users in some cases cursing me for this uninstallation error / upgrade issue which I can understand, they have better things to do and no clue how to fix it anyway. Even with my experience it has taken a few hours of faffing about(which I am not getting paid for either) to find this fix after trying all sorts of stuff <br /><br />so ..................................<br /><br />This issue is out there and affects some percentage of users who are potential donors and probably eventually paying customers, can I suggest that this thread is pinned, clearly labled as a probable fix for the cannot install / upgrade issue and linked on your sourceforge homepage with instructions.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Jonah
