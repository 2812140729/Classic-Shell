I might be alone in that, but my thinking is that tiles can be good for keyboard use, since when you've selected a tile, you can have 4 other tiles adjacent to the selected tile (and therefore they can be selected with a single keypress), unlike the limit of 2 items present in the list-style programs menus of all existing menu types. Then again, I don't use any Metro apps which use Live information on their Tiles, so maybe I just don't get it... ._____.

Live Tiles on the other hand - forget them. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Also the column for pinned large icons needs to be the left most because jumplists and submenus open to the right. Compatibility with existing skins needs to be maintained and I wouldn't want any more core Start menu styles added either - Classic, Classic with two columns and Windows 7 style are more than enough for me. The expanded pinning area can be an optional addition to these 3 styles.

Win7 Style has a great L&amp;F. That's why the idea of extending it to facilitate Preview Menu-like features worries me - you don't get the L&amp;F of the new Menu Style, only a few of its features tacked onto an existing style. But on the flipside, the two styles aren't really all that different - the only major changes are as follows:<br /><br />-The pinned programs list is on the right and takes the form of tiles<br />-The folders list is now on the left, above the recent items list<br />-The shutdown button is at the top right corner of the left column<br />-The user name actually exists<br />-The user image is in the top left of the left column<br /><br />Seems like a lot, but to me it doesn't seem like enough to break the idea of recycling the .skin7 format, so long as there's a flag akin to TWO_COLUMNS to change certain values depending on the current menu style.<br /><br />Am I spewing nonsense or am I on to something...?

(which I'm not so sure your style is) so you would probably actually get closer to your style by having more customization, than a pre-defined style...

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I was thinking that emblems could fit into the 'customize start menu' section of the start menu settings. That would make it more user friendly than using resource hacker. I can make a concept art for it too. This would be like the way that Jcee's calculator menu is done which could also work for emblems too. <br /><br />Another idea is a 3rd party .skin creator, but that is a lot more work.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />emblems are just a 'patch' not a real solution. and they never will be directly for the end-user... They would be good for something like custom shutdown buttons, or whatnot, or really advanced skins modeled in a similar fashion as Microsoft's BOB. <br /><br /><br />Though with user-defined variables you can ALREADY develop a skin with easily changeable emblems... (those emblems just can't have links)<br /><br />Firstly the features employed in the 'calc' menu I made aren't available in the windows 7 style. and it's rather complicated to set-up. though, a checkbox for 'force small icon' would allow you to use larger tiles (without making the icons for everything else in the menu obscenely large)

Column 2 frame to imitate the tile size.<br /><br />If there are 8 emblems available, put 8 custom emblem tiles in the visible skin options,( all a specific size,and position),<br />for users to change out to what they like.<br />Emblem tile links, maybe in future?<br /><br />Everything saved as xml file.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Oh, alright. For me, it seems that emblems are the only solution so far to create tiles for start menu's. Though I'm not sure what would have to happen for tiles to be fully supported. <br /><br />User-defined variables? That sounds cool actually. Like if you were to give a start menu skin user defined options?<br /><br />I didn't know that you couldn't make the calc menu with the windows 7 style. I think I do like the classic two-column style menu better, it has the two option boxes under 'customize start menu' where you can drag over new items and such.<br /><br />I use 48px for the classic shell toolbar, so I don't mind this size. The solid icon frames idea is pretty good. Solid icon frames would work good for tiles with icons. Maybe not with ones with full images, like a picture of a meadow for your pictures folder 200px by 100px  or something. <br /><br />The visible emblem idea you &amp; Jcee said would be good as well.
