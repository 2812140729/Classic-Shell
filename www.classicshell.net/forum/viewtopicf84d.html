		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi All!<br /><br />I was wondering if someone could help me.  <br /><br />I have several PC's with Windows 8 (or 8.1) on them and I've installed classic shell on them all to see if I can replicate the issue which I can.  <br /><br />So I do the following:<br /><br />1.  Click the start button<br />2.  In &quot;search programs and files&quot; type in a file name - this then pops up with no problems at all and is listed.  <br />3.  Click on &quot;see more results&quot; <br />4.  Nothing is listed at all here, not even the files that were found originally.<br /><br />So why is this?  Does anyone know?  it doesn't matter how many or how few files there are to find, when you click on &quot;see more results&quot; none of them show up.  This feature works fine in Windows 7 but it doesn't work in classic shell.  <br /><br />Can someone help me?

No change.  There cannot be indexing issues on all 3 of the machines i've tested on.  <br /><br />My theory is that the classic shell start bar search doesn't play well with Windows 8 search... they completely redid the search on Windows 8 and made explorer more powerful, is there a chance that this is a bug?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />After some testing and playing with the Windows Search Advanced Query Syntax, I can reproduce the issue on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. Here's what I tested. In my case, if I type just a few keywords (e.g. flowers) and click 'See more results', I get the results of flowers pictures in Explorer that I get in the Start Menu.<br /><br />But if I use some property from the AQS, e.g. flowers kind:pictures then the Classic Start Menu shows me results correctly but I get nothing when I click &quot;See more results&quot;. On Windows 7, if I use the original Windows 7 Start Menu (WSM) to do the same, it correctly returns me all the results in &quot;See more results&quot; even for a complex query.

If I then click on &quot;See More results&quot; it works too and brings up all of the search results in an unsorted list (unsorted by application where the search term is found).<br />the problem is if I search for a term and it brings up the nice ordered list of results - broken down into their respective application or type where found (e.g. Files,  Emails,  Pictures,  Etc....).  The problem arises if I click on one the sub category &quot;Files&quot;.  It indicates how many hits there are (e.g. 40) but the resultant list is only containing a couple of results and the heading of the search location is set to &quot;Search Results in CLSID_StartMenuProviderFolder&quot;<br />If I click the other subcategories they are fine.<br />thanks<br />Paul

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />@classicshellfan, for your first problem, check the properties of the file whose contents are not getting indexed. Go to its Properties -&gt; Advanced and check 'Allow this file to have contents indexed'. Try including the file in your Documents Library.<br /><br />About your second problem and what others are also facing in this thread, there seems to be a problem with &quot;See more results&quot; functionality in some cases but we need a reliable way to reproduce it. It has happened to me too - these weird behaviors.<br /><br />Sometimes 'See more results' actually shows less results than what the Start Menu shows as 'smipx013' said. Sometimes 'See more results' is empty as 'ammit1984' said and I've also had the Explorer window opening and closing immediately bug which 'classicshellfan' mentions. I will have to find a way to reproduce the issue, only then it can be fixed. Some of them might be Windows Explorer bugs or broken behavior because the menu passes on the query to Explorer as Ivo said.

Open Start Menu Settings<br />2. Go to Customize Start Menu tab<br />3. Now:<br /><br />3-A:<br />If using <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">classic style</span></strong>, add a sub-item for the &quot;Search Box&quot; item by dragging &quot;Custom&quot; from the right column and dropping it over the &quot;Search Box&quot; in the left column. Then double click Custom and enter this URL I mentioned above as the &quot;Command&quot;.<br />search-ms:&amp;crumb=location:::{9343812E-1C37-4A49-A12E-4B2D810D956B}&amp;crumb=%2<br /><br />Enter a text label, for example, See results in Explorer... and pick an icon.<br /><br />OR<br /><br />3-B:<br />If using <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Windows 7 style</span></strong>, add a Custom item on the Customize Start Menu tab by pressing the Insert key. Change &quot;Administrative Tools&quot; to &quot;Custom&quot;. Now double click the icon of the &quot;Custom&quot; item and enter this URL I mentioned above as the &quot;Command&quot;.<br /><br />search-ms:&amp;crumb=location:::{9343812E-1C37-4A49-A12E-4B2D810D956B}&amp;crumb=%2<br /><br />Enter a text label, for example, See results in Explorer... and pick an icon.<br /><br />Now when you search for anything and click See results in Explorer... the results in your Explorer window that opens will be consistent with what the Classic Start Menu shows.<br /><br />For now, you will have to ignore the built-in item called &quot;See More Results&quot; and use &quot;See results in Explorer...&quot; that you added manually.<br /><br />Essentially, if you use more of the Advanced Query Syntax, the current implementation of &quot;See More Results&quot; sometimes returns an empty Explorer window whereas a search provider defined with this URL returns results consistent with the Start menu.
