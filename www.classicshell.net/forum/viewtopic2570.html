So, I converted the Metro theme's colors to match (for Windows 7 start menu style only), and I have attached the skin here.<br /><br />After applying the skin, you will need to do one more thing to get the colors to 100% match the the Windows start menu:<br />1) Enable &quot;Show all settings&quot;<br />2) Go to &quot;Menu Look&quot;<br />3) Enable &quot;Override Glass Color&quot;<br />4) Set the menu glass color to: 808080<br /><br />I hope you will find this useful.<br /><br /><strong>Note that any skin mods such as this one which are based on the Metro skin and depend on the Windows 8/Windows 10 color engine will not work on Windows 7.</strong>

I'm probably gonna stick with 7 for now, since my hardware works better with it. I'm not worried about it getting out-of-date, since I only boot into it occasionally for some music production and games. I use Kubuntu as my main OS.

There are multiple problems with this:<br />First, determining the color of the taskbar is not straight-forward. It depends on multiple registry settings and the behavior can change at any time. It gets even more complicated when you factor in transparency and things like high-contrast modes. That's not even counting other conditions, like different versions of Windows, and third-party software like Classic Shell and Start10.<br /><br />Second, you can't simply change the color of the start menu to be any color. The menu needs an entire set of colors for the background, text, various highlights and UI elements. Imagine if you pick white text on white background. It will be unreadable.

For example this skin looks great but the Control Panel or Shut Down or Recent Items when shown as menus are drawn in opaque black not as the start menu itself lightly transparent.<br />Is this something I can change myself?<br /><br />and most importantly I need something like this for the &quot;classic with 2 columns&quot; mode<br /><br />I think that the closest thing is the &quot;Smoked Glass&quot; skin but with it's round edges it doesn't fit the whole edginess of Win 10 so it seems that a hybrid between it and the Metro skin is what I'd really like to use.

I tend to run away from those skins. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />If there was a small guide added to the Metro colors sticky note, showing how to use the colors text, and describe the blue part, or rainbow colored bitmaps, we could all mod them. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Like why does the tint not make the menu color darker?<br />example: <br /><br />Main_bitmap=$SystemAccentDark3<br />Main_bitmap_tint1=$ApplicationText<br /><br /><br />I was doing the cheating way of making 2 column, by renaming &quot;Metro-Win10-Black.skin7&quot; to &quot;Metro-Win10-Black.skin&quot;<br />Some things are screwed up, as it's not the proper way to convert a skin.<br />It was working half ok. I started making some changes to have icon frames option reg, or bright. <br /><br />Took a screenshot, then made too many changes at once, and got the white start menu of death. I never made a back up.<br />Oh well. It's trash. I could probably make a skin that uses all glass color for opaque skin, <br />but to get rid of all the glass Metro color in blur transparent mode, would have to override color like mrbumpy409 recommends.<br />The problem is the icon frame color would go back to grey. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Lets hope mrbumpy409 comes back from other operating system and makes skin for you.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Tint colors are easy. You know how you have the mask that lets you mix the glass color and the Windows menu color? Tints are just a generalization of that approach.<br />So the mask has Red, Green and Blue channels. Tint1 is mixed according to R, Tint2 according to G and Tint3 according to B.<br /><br />You can use tints for two different purposes. One is to mix multiple colors, of course. The other is if you have a mask that has shapes drawn in its Red, Green or Blue channels. Then the tint colors will be used to draw those shapes. For example the Metro skin background has a thin red line between the columns. It is drawn with the Tint1 color, which is set to use the highlight color.<br /><br />The Metro colors are simply named colors that exist in Windows 8 and up. They are used to draw the Metro UI. You can change the color set from the Metro customization screen. The idea is that Windows creates an entire set that is guaranteed to work together. For example the text color must look good on the background color.<br /><br />You can use the Classic Shell Utility to preview the current Metro colors, as well as other available sets. You can download the utility from here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/downloads">http://www.classicshell.net/downloads</a><!-- m -->

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks Ivo.<br />I will have to reread your comments many times for it to sink in.<br />I'm still inside the snow globe, not knowing there's a forth dimension outside.<br /><br />I can understand when the three colors are in a set like the scroll bitmaps, or a start button. <br />So each color corresponds to rest, hover, pressed.<br />It's where say, the main bitmap mask 1 is one channel blended into another, <br />going down the bitmap. What assigns the break point?<br />Hmm, I just realized that's the 1 column bitmap, not the 2 column. <br />Ah ok. So if I have got it right,<br />You gave it a Tint1= the red color<br />Tint2= the green color that blends together, for the nice windows caption area gradient.<br /><br />I gather mrbumpy409 has stripped away the dollar sign &quot;$ metro color&quot;, and resorted back to windows menu, Areo glass colors.<br />Possibly because could not be figured out how to make the color darker, just like me. <br /><br />Now, I'm looking at the Win 7 metro bitmap mask 1.<br /><br />The original text is like this:<br /><br />Main_bitmap=$SystemAccentDark1|$StartBackground<br />Main_bitmap_tint1=$StartHighlight<br /><br />So the tint1 only applies to the red channel built in vertical separator.<br />I would need to add a green channel on rest of the bitmap, to make a tint 2 blend, with an amount of 1 to 255.<br /><br /><br />Then if I put this text, with the added tint2 referenced to black, it should mix and hopefully make darker?<br /><br />Main_bitmap=$SystemAccentDark3|$StartBackground<br />Main_bitmap_tint1=$StartHighlight<br />Main_bitmap_tint2=$ApplicationText<br /><br />Just trying now....<br />It appears to make it darker, yes.<br /><br />I'm a little confused as to how Main_background=$SystemAccentDark1|$StartBackground<br />goes with everything. I do understand the fallback part.<br /><br />No more time until next weekend.<br />Bye<br /><br />ps The utility is easier to use from before. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

It can be a picture or a solid color. Then you mix the 3 tints with the following weights:<br />Tint1: Red<br />Tint2: Green<br />Tint3: Blue<br />Base: 255-Red-Green-Blue<br /><br />If you want to make a color darker, you will have to mix in some black. for example:<br />Main_bitmap_tint2=#000000<br /><br />The mask doesn't have to be a picture. It can be a numeric value as well:<br />Main_new_selection=$SystemAccentDark1|$StartBackground<br />Main_new_selection_tint1=$StartInlineErrorText<br />Main_new_selection_mask=#7F0000<br /><br />Basically that will mix the #SystemAccentDark1 color and #StartInlineErrorText color in a ratio about 50/50. The idea is to make the background for new programs a bit more yellow than the standard selection color.

It uses the Win 10 default accent color. If you want accentdark1/2/3, you would have to open up the skin file with ResourceHacker to change the icon frame color tint text manually. It won't look exactly like Win10 original, <br />coz the CSM selector is above the frames. I remember making a two tone skin to resemble that Windows10 look. <br />It's just not worth it, for icon size and dpi has to be exact. Maybe Ivo can put some code in somewhere to imitate Windows10?<br />Made submenu transparency option with just a little alpha transparency, to keep it looking black tinted.<br /><br /><br />What I found is, these two CSM options in &quot;Menu Look&quot; tab are very helpful:<br />&quot;Override glass color&quot; and &quot;Glass opacity&quot;.<br /><br />To get mrbumpy409's recommendation, set the menu glass color to: 808080<br />If you want it to match dark taskbar, set the menu glass color to: 161616<br />Or for standard Win10 menu grey color, set the menu glass color to: 555555<br /><br />If you want the residual glass color to show through, disable Override glass color.<br />To get opaque glass colored, change Glass opacity from default to 100% <br />Also factor depends on your personalize Windows accent color settings, picked, or auto. <br /><br /><br />Thanks mrbumpy409 <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Also one more time, the pagers still have color. If you want it neutral grey, the &quot;;&quot; can be removed in the skin file to override.<br /><br />ps: I'm part Canadian. My words fluctuate back &amp; forth between grey/gray, color/colour on a daily basis. <br />I'm sure you can understand <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Read below.<br /><br /><br /><br />Metro-Win10-Black-Glyphs [WIN7 style]<br />I carried over features that were in the Classic 2 column skin.<br />This version of mrbumpy409 skin has option to turn on glyphs screenshot on second column.<br />Most of glyphs are from a font file in Windows 10, Dave Stewart's, or some made by hand.<br /><br />Have to stress, you can't change the way the second column looks. <br />Positions stuck that way, can't customize it.<br />Can only work at exactly 100%/96dpi , or 125%/120dpi, or 150%/144dpi.<br />The glyph emblem is only a image of all the glyphs in one picture, not separate icons.<br />Sorry. <br />The option can only be used when menu is set up with the default entries in the second column.<br />It will go out of alignment, if not exact. <br />If another entry is required with a glyph, <br />set the link position below &quot;Run&quot; command with &quot;Customize Start Menu&quot; tab in CSM settings.<br />If an extra glyph folder is picked without a link set, <br />there may not be enough padding at shutdown button. Pick &quot;none&quot; in this case.<br /><br /><br /><br />I included a default xml setup file.<br />I changed the large icon size to 24 size for use with 100% menu size.<br />This only affects column 1, not column 2.<br />For 150% menu size, change to 36 large icon size.<br /><br />Menu shadow is turned off.<br /><br />I turned on &quot;Overide glass color&quot; setting to 404040 setting, in order to reduce the small amount of glass color.<br />If you want that weak color, uncheck the overide box.<br /><br />I turned on &quot;Downloads&quot; glyph. If you don't want it, set Glyph folder to none, and turn off Downloads link in &quot;Customize Start Menu.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Notes.<br />Skin is for Win10, appears to work on Win8.<br />Oddly, half works on Win7. Have to turn off Metro Accent icon frames, <br />and because Win7 does not have a Metro &quot;PC settings&quot; link, glyphs are all out of wack unusable. <br />I guess a different link could be set up to replace PC settings, but this plain skin does not match the look of the Win7 system, anyway. <br /><br /><br />If you hate the game glyph link, not much one can do.<br />If you want to edit out the game glyph with a different one, <br />the main glyph png images strips are: <br /><br />Image 101 100% size<br />Image 103 150% size <br />Image 102 125% size<br /><br /><br /><br />I had to make mrbumpy409 selector more transparent, for the fake glyphs would be hard to see underneath. <br />Thanks Mr Bumpy and cheerio. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: I borrowed user picture frame from shpkong's skin, <br />so is now User-Picture-Outside skin. U-P-O.<br /><br />EDIT:DOH!<br />Forgot to put metro search arrows in - fixed.

There are few people doing that over the net ( gsw953 surely is one of the most known for his beautiful themes ) and he posts them on deviantart , thing I don't for personal reasons. <br />The icons are windows default ones so you should have the same at devices , I found a link to the sexy girl as wallpaper I used to build the theme<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../www.carlosserrao.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/VMAG_SHOT_01_MARGOT_ROBBIE_0188-4.jpg">http://www.carlosserrao.com/wp-content/ ... 0188-4.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><img src="../../s14.postimg.org/d28vwy0o1/Snap4.png" alt="" /><br /><br /><br />You can give an eye on some work from my own<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://mykou.deviantart.com/">http://mykou.deviantart.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I also have a youtube channel dedicated to windows 10 tutorial and customisation , here is how it looks and Juniper told you the truth as I made some break but I keep being active for my followers ^^: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE-WBvZ4oqs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE-WBvZ4oqs</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BSBvQILPf4&amp;list=PL7Qu_n9WXa11W1BcRWogaMJDzPRTi3Fo8&amp;index=45">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BSBvQI ... 8&amp;index=45</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I also made a tutorial serie ( 7 vids ) for CSM , Gaurav asked me to translate in US language but I'm too busy and hadn't time to realize all my whishes <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Cheers
