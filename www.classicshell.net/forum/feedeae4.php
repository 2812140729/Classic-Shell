I apologize if this is covered elsewhere, but as I don't know what the artifact to which I'm referring is called, I can't search for it.<br /><br />It's the ... thing ... right below the menubar (File, Edit, View, etc.). I don't want it to be there -- I don't use it, and it's just a waste of space -- but since I don't know what it's called I don't know where to look. I've tried every checkbox that seems even remotely relevant, to no avail.<br /><br />The contents of this [i]thing[/i] in the attached screen cap (enclosed in a rounded-corner square orange box) are: Organize, Open, Include selected folder in library, Share with, Email, Burn, New Folder.
