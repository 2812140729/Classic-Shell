Just few remarks:<br />1. the initial start is a bit slow but after that it works ok (maybe indexing something)<br />2. executables that require admin rights (UAC prompt) are not marked with shield like in win 7 menu<br />3. when searching through the start menu and the returned list is very large even if i expand the arrows in from of the groups there is no scrollbar show up nor i can navigate to all results.<br /><br />And finally i'd like to ask you....<br />Since i am making software like you <a href="http://better-explorer.com/" class="postlink">http://better-explorer.com/</a><br />I'd like to add an option &quot;Pin to StartMenu&quot; that to work with your startmenu in win 8. Can you give me guidelines how to implement this so to work with your menu? (i am using c# and WPF) <br />Thank you!<br /><br />Greetings,<br />Dimitar Tsenev

Pin shell extension of Classic Start Menu is limited to EXE and LNK. It can't be reg edited to expand it to folders or other files. Pin to Start in Windows 8 can be reg edited to enable it for ANY file type.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />No, that's wrong. The search in the start menu is to find what you need so you can launch it. Ideally it should show a single result - the one you are looking for. Everything else is noise.<br /><br />This is not a file browser intended to show multiple results to select them, copy, delete, etc. There are tools better suited or that. Like, I don't know, Explorer for example.

I did sent Ivo's a message. Also about my program. Basically is still in beta stage so there could be problems on some systems. And the latest source have many fixes about this.<br />My program uses parts of windows but all that parts are heavily hooked (plus some fixes that Microsoft didn't fix <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) so i have 70% control over everything in it. Almost all needed is under my control.<br /><br />About the pin to start menu function i'd like to add a button in the ribbon in my explorer thats why i need more info how to do that.

There are no options for regex or wildcards. Keep in mind that the underlying technology is a SQL database, and for faster searches you have to limit the query to what is indexed.
