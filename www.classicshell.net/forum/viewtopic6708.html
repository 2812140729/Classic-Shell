		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />In early August (<em><span style="text-decoration: underline">specifically only on one day</span></em>, Aug 2nd, 2016) and <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">only for a few hours</span></em>, the download mirror which a third party website, FossHub, was hosting for Classic Shell version 4.3.0 got hacked by some hackers calling themselves Peggle Crew. They did not tamper with the Classic Shell files, instead they managed to replace the installer file with another fake installer containing a trojan that when launched, corrupts the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the PC. This renders the computer unbootable.<br /><br />As soon as the hack was detected, the download link on the main site <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/">http://www.classicshell.net</a><!-- m --> was fixed to link to a clean installer file. Classic Shell became once again safe to download immediately after the hack was detected within a few hours and the fake installer replaced with a genuine one.<br /><br /><strong>Those of who who pay attention to the UAC prompt in Windows should not have gotten infected because the authentic installer is digitally signed and shows a green UAC prompt along with the developer's name, whereas the fake one shows a bright yellow UAC prompt indicating a warning. The infection can only happen if you say Yes to the UAC prompt of the fake installer, not if you doubled click it but said No to the UAC prompt.</strong><br /><br />Here is a FAQ for those of you whose PC got affected by malware when they accidentally downloaded and ran the hacked installer on August 2nd, 2016. Anyone else downloading the current installer after August 2 or now should rest assured that it is clean and free of malware. You can verify this by checking the digital signature of the installer's properties.<br /><br /><strong>How do I know I have downloaded the correct file?</strong><br />There are few things to watch for:<ul><li> Check the file properties in Explorer – right-click -&gt; Properties. Look for a tab named “Digital Signatures”. It should list “Ivaylo Beltchev” as the signer. The hacked file doesn’t even display the “Digital Signatures” tab.</li><li> When you run the real installer it will not immediately ask you for admin permissions. Only after you finish selecting your settings you will be asked. The hacked file asks right away.</li><li> The prompt for permissions will be blue for the real file and say &quot;Verified publisher: Ivaylo Beltchev&quot;. The fake file will show a yellow prompt and say &quot;Publisher: Unknown&quot;.</li><li> The fake file will of course not install Classic Shell. It will just flicker once and exit. So if you managed to install Classic Shell 4.3.0, then you had the right file and you are safe</li></ul><br /><strong>What do I do if I launched the fake file and got infected?</strong><br />If you haven’t rebooted yet, save your work and back up your important files. If things go very wrong you may have to reinstall Windows and will lose your files.<br />Also make sure you have a working Windows 10 disk before rebooting. You can make one using the instructions here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/softwar ... /windows10</a><!-- m --><br />To repair the MBR, follow the instructions here:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopica0a2.html?f=12&amp;t=6440">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=6440</a><!-- l --><br />Also in video form:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD9CvHVU7B4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD9CvHVU7B4</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There are also few forum threads with useful information:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicebef.html?f=12&amp;t=6434">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=6434</a><!-- l --><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic57aa.html?f=12&amp;t=6437">viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=6437</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Reddit thread about the hack and possible fixes:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4vw21h/massive_psa_do_not_download_classic_shell_read">https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/c ... shell_read</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Once again, we assure you that except for a few hours on August 2nd, 2016 when Classic Shell's installer was hacked, Classic Shell is completely safe to use again.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" /><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;"><strong>Here's a recap of what exactly happened for those who are worried about the hack:</strong><br /><br /><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">● This was a very new malware. At the time when it was being spread, very few anti-virus apps detected it - only Kaspersky, AVG and something else and that too, only as a <em>generic threat, not as a specific trojan </em>-</span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#272a34;">● </span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Classic Shell is safe once again to download</strong>.</span><span style="color:#272a34;"> The main download is currently from another hosting service called MediaFire which was not hacked. The website hosting it at that time &#40;FossHub&#41; was hacked and only for a few hours on 1 particular day. Ever since, Classic Shell&#39;s installer is clean and you don&#39;t have to be worried about getting infected as long as you don&#39;t ignore the UAC prompt which shows a blue band for signed executables.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#272a34;">● The attack was timed by whoever hacked the installer to coincide with the release of Windows 10 Anniversary Update which was removing older versions of Classic Shell without giving any details except some unexplained &quot;incompatibility&quot; message in the Action Center. So users would head to the main download site and the compromised installer would infect their PC.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#272a34;">● This affects UEFI/GPT partitions too and makes them unbootable just like BIOS/MBR partitions. Secure Boot should not be affected. Whether your MBR is infected or GPT, it is easy to recover/fix and your data is not erased or encrypted. But the fact that it makes the PC unbootable scares novice users who have no idea how to fix it.</span></span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">● This attack occurred because of a breach in FossHub&#39;s security and not due to a vulnerability in Classic Shell&#39;s website or installer. They have rectified the situation. They posted an apology on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4vzovk/fosshub_statement_regarding_2nd_august_security/" class="postlink">https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4vzovk/fosshub_statement_regarding_2nd_august_security/</a> Still, Classic Shell&#39;s main hosting now uses another service, MediaFire.<br /><br />● If you always use the built-in updater to update Classic Shell, it downloads from another location &#40;MediaFire&#41; that was not compromised. Also it is digitally signed so its authenticity can be verified.</span></span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">● The impact of the attack was limited. We noticed that Windows 10 was removing Classic Shell as &quot;incompatible&quot; and wasn&#39;t giving any details about what the incompatibility was. So an updated version of Classic Shell for Windows 10 Anniversary Update was released 2 days before the attack &#40;2 days before the Anniversary Update became publicly available&#41;. This was done so that Windows 10 would not remove the compatible version. Classic Shell gets millions of downloads per month. Because the update was rolled out in advance, the fake installer &#40;which did not have Classic Shell at all&#41; was downloaded approximately around 300 times, not thousands or millions of times.</span></span><br /><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: 100%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color:#272a34;"><span style="font-family:Open Sans, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">● The Classic Shell installer is digitally signed so when you download it from the official website or from another download service that the website links to, you can verify the genuine vs fake installer using the Windows UAC prompt. The genuine installer will be digitally signed by Ivaylo Beltchev who is the developer of Classic Shell.</span></span></span>

The bios boot menu says it is UEFI what I'm booting, and diskpart list disk says it's GPT.<br /><br />Windows recovery was not able to fix the boot problem, so I tried the integrated system image restore function of Windows 10 by booting from my Windows 10 install USB stick. The USB stick was created by the Microsoft Media Creation tool. The system image was created by me before the update with the &quot;Backup and Restore (Windows 7)&quot; tool from within Windows.<br /><br />It worked this way. I don't know what else that malware overwrote to ruin the system, so this was the most safe solution for me. Fortunately, I had that system image - I created it right before Windows 10 started to download the Anniversary update that evening.

Is this possible ? Btw, shows up as unallocated in Computer Management</div><br /><br /><br />This is what happened to me. That drive probably had an unused MBR. My system continued to boot but a second drive was &quot;unallocated&quot;. It can be repaired but the Windows troubleshooting command-line method (bootrec /fixmbr) <span style="text-decoration: underline">will not</span> do it. It only works on your boot disk. I tried it and it wiped out my Linux boot menu, so beware.<br /><br />I used the open source tool TestDisk to fix my partition but it is not for the faint of heart. I tried other tools but they did not correctly handle my 3TB drive or they cost too much or they did not address the actual problem. I'm sorry I can't recommend an easy fix but there may be some listed in these forums or elsewhere. <br /><br />Your files should be safe but be careful with the tools you use. I used MiniTool Partition Wizard and it malfunctioned. By all appearances it was going to fix the problem but when the fix was applied, it did not correctly handle my 3TB drive. I was able to recover using TestDisk.<br /><br />One final note: I ran CHKDSK on the drive after I got it working again. It reported &quot;corrupt basic file structure&quot; for 179 files. The files appeared to be perfectly usable and showed no problems. When CHKDSK &quot;repaired&quot; them, all their data was erased. Be careful. If you see these kinds of errors reported, try to backup the affected files before attempting to repair them. If you can, I advise transferring all of your files to a new drive and then reformatting your damaged disk to clear out any remaining weirdness.<br /><br />Good luck.

Avast, my antivirus, caused me to bluescreen due to an incompatibility with the Anniversary update on newer Intel CPUs. So even when I fixed my master boot record, I was stuck in a boot loop and had no idea what to do.<br /><br />But the only reason I discovered the boot loop is because I fixed my master boot record, and it's really easy.<br />I simply borrowed a family member's laptop to make myself a boot disk (just download the Windows ISO of your system and slap it on a disk or USB drive), used it to get into the recovery environment for Windows, opened the command prompt, and used the command &quot;bootec /fixmbr&quot;. That got me to the windows loading screen, which gave me a BSOD every time because of Avast. <br /><br />All in all, don't panic. The boot record is really easy to fix with little technical knowledge, and none of your personal files will be tampered with.

A cyber criminal did.</div>Get your terminology right. &quot;hacker&quot; is a generic term for people that modify software typically without acces to the source code.<br /><br />Black Hat Hackers = Bad Guys<br />White Hat Hackers = Good Guys</div><br />Was just about to comment on this <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Though 'white hat' hackers are 'good' most of what they do is still illegal.. and obviously subjectively good.... Its even possible that the recent hackers that hacked classic shell see themselves as white-hats because they supposedly did it to draw attention to a major hole in Fosshubs security. Yes rendering thousands of computers Inoperable is bad, but the fix is fairly simple; and causing a splash is sometimes the only way to get noticed. Also it could have been way worse.. (like wiping the whole hard drive, or stealthily stealing credit-card info)

And a hacker is &quot;good&quot; because he modifies things in order to learn or just for fun, legal or illegal. A hacker never tries to mess other people computer, a hacker never tries to do evil things.<br /><br />So, hacker = police, and cyber criminal = robber.<br /><br />You could say &quot;but a police can be corrupted and be a bad guy&quot;. Yeah, you're right, that's your &quot;black hat hacker&quot;, but you know, that¡s atypical, and normally police do good things.<br /><br />This attack was intended to damage computer's all over the world, so a hacker does not fit in that category.

But the ultimate goal is just adding things for fun and use devices in a way they weren't intended to be used. For example, a hacker would modify the Wii so it can read PS3 games, or modify a PS4 so it can be used as a toaster, or add a WiFi card to a PS1 so you can watch YouTube through it. A hacker would never try to hurt anyone's devices or steal your information, just like a policeman would never rob a bank.<br /><br />To sum up, hacker can't have any negative connotation, as police can't have any negative connotation by definition. Sure a police can commit a crime or a hacker can commit a cyber attack like this one, but then automatically the hacker wouldn't be considered a hacker anymore, but a cyber criminal.<br /><br />It's like saying an innocent man killed a kid last night. That's exactly what we are saying. The time you kill someone, you automatically stop being innocent and you become a criminal.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I had problems yesterday (August 22, 2016).   I kept getting a pop up saying I needed to update Classic Shell, and I will admit we were driving and I wasn't paying alot of attention, was just trying to get some work done (I was a passenger), so clicked yet, then got stopped because an admin had to approve the upgrade.   It didn't look like either of the examples shown from the original problem, but after 3 reboots yesterday I suddenly had no internet, airplane mode was stuck in on.    I THINK this had something to do with the stupid Windows 10 Anniversary update and possibly Classic Shell being hacked as well, but in the end I had to restore my software to it's original factory standards and am now downloading all my software again.    Just wanted to mention this in case anyone else had something similar going on now.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I just had an issue of a similar nature (8-24-16) where the recent windows 10 update removed the software without any warning due to some 'incompatibility'. I double-checked the file signature from the download as recommended above and forced the install (windows 10 start menu destroys my workflow, it's just so distracting and obnoxious to use) and it's working just fine on a Dell XPS 13. No issues so far.
