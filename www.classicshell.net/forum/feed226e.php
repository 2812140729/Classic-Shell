Yes, translate the required text without any formatting errors, for your level of localization and send it to Ivo. The DLL once published can be downloaded and copied to the folder: C:\ProgramData\ClassicShell\Languages.<br /><br />Then you need to sign out of your Windows user account and login again, and you will be able to pick that language from the Language tab of Settings.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Fri Mar 24, 2017 7:27 am</p><hr />

<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7408&amp;p=31928#p31928"><![CDATA[
Hi there<br /><br />My name is Jason Johnston and I am giving technical assistance to Hannah Sarvasy of the Australian National University in her project to provide localized software for the Nungon people of Papua New Guinea.<br /><br />Nungon is a tribal language spoken by about 2,000 people in the Morobe province of PNG. The Nungon Localization Project aims to provide a range of software, including a graphical user interface (Classic Shell) and a text editor (Notepad++) in the Nungon language.<br /><br />For Classic Shell, we are interested in doing a Level 1 localization for now. We have downloaded the three L10N.ini files and plan to provide translations for the strings in them during a field trip to Nungon territory next month (April). We understand that we would then send a text file (or 3 text files?) containing the translated strings to Ivo at this forum, who would create a DLL for us. I am a little unclear as to what would happen then.<br /><br />I would just like confirmation that our understanding of the procedure is correct. Also, I wanted to advise that it is unlikely that the Nungon localization files would be of any great interest to anyone outside the Nungon community (Nungon being such a &quot;small&quot; language, albeit of vital importance to its speakers). So we don't imagine there would be much general demand for the Nungon-localized DLL - but of course we would be totally happy for it to be generally available. Is there likely to be any problem with localizing such a &quot;small&quot; language?<br /><br />We look forward to working with you!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=18486">jcjohnston</a> — Thu Mar 23, 2017 10:34 pm</p><hr />
