		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello meetHG. I looked up your name. It means part of ice, or of the moon?<br /><br />Yep, or Han jee. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />The darkened mod I made was on purpose, from past experience with picture menus. <br />It is to avoid any possibility of having white background with white text, which is unreadable.<br />See my first picture skin, made before patterns feature (built into bitmap), with the tint option:<br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicaec5.html?f=17&amp;t=2385">viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=2385</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Even Win 10 does it when in tablet mode. <br /><br />Your skin could be made so it will only do that if external picture, like on one of shpkong's modded skins. As that is where we have no control over what picture the person picks to use.<br />I forget which one. One of his V3 types.<br /><br />It just takes more bitmaps put in to cover all the circumstances involved, <br />backed up with headers with AND, NOT, and OR combinations.<br /><br />Aye, yes. So many variables that have to be taken into account, which leads to more confusion.<br />The headers need to be in a special order logically to work properly.<br />Really have to hunker down away from distractions, to figure it all out. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />About using patterns instead of tint colors. When I was using tint colors, same as yours, there were certain conditons where I could not achieve dark grey borders. It blended in to same color below threshhold. The transparency to desktop background refused to get any darker. It was neat effect though. Same as other effect, where at one stage, I had the menu slit part as transparent, with the border boundaries totally opaque without any tint color. <br /><br />I wish there was some in-skin-file option that could remove the glass color as strongly as in the CSM glass overide/opacity settings.<br /><br />Anyway, you have gained a lot of knowledge now, and yay, Gaurav is helping you out now. <br />It is time for me to throw in the towel.<br />I don't think I can help you any further. You are now master apprentice. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />I go back to my novice roots.<br />If there is something that you really need to get a good answer to, <br />maybe send a personal message directly to Ivo.<br /><br />Bye. <br /><br />I just deleted the blue ray file from previous post. Stopped it at 57 downloads.<br /><br />I will download and try out your new revised skin tonight or tomorrow. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Either way has good points.<br />If you want more solid, go the pattern way. For more ever-changing blending effect stick with your way.<br /><br />Something else I was saying from before. It looks as though on your skin, <br />one can get the opaque border with transparent inner menu part,<br />by having &quot;Glass Throughout&quot; and &quot;Show Background Card Color&quot; turned on.<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't take me as being mean for what I'm going to say. <br />I just have to pretend I'm trying out skin for first time.<img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The &quot;Main Menu Transparency&quot; settings are still a bit confusing to understand. <br />I don't know. Transparent what? Transparent borders if no image? Glass what? <br />Could a word be put beside to describe more. example &quot;Transparent boundaries when activated&quot;<br /><br />or have them all setup with default neutral grey transparency values. <br />Think about it for awhile. <br />It's not really needed, but could make it easier to understand, and even more useful.<br />They could apply to all those transparency selections.<br />I put it in a text file. Feel free to use. If not appropriate, no sweat. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><br />OK, back to other things now.<br /><br />Because skin has so many options, it might be intimidating for user, the first time.<br />For default first time menu view, could have so black arrows show instead of white, <br />so everything matches and looks the best it can be:<br /><br />from<br />OPTION WHITEARROW=&quot;Use White Arrows In Main Menu&quot;,1<br />OPTION SUBWHITEARROW=&quot;Use White Arrows In Submenus&quot;,1<br /><br />to<br /><br />OPTION WHITEARROW=&quot;Use White Arrows In Main Menu&quot;,<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">0</span><br />OPTION SUBWHITEARROW=&quot;Use White Arrows In Submenus&quot;,<span style="background-color:#ffff00;">0</span><br /><br /><br />At 144 dpi, the bigger arrows look ok. Maybe Gaurav is using an older skin version?<br /><br />Here is something like Gaurav was talking about, that gets activated with touch screens,<br />to make the arrow area bigger, for finger tapping. <br /><br /><br />[TOUCH_ENABLED]<br />Main_split_arrow_padding=14,14,100%<br />Main2_split_arrow_padding=14,14,100%<br />Main2_text_padding=1,10,8,10,100%<br />Shutdown_arrow_padding=14,14,100%<br />Shutdown_text_padding=10,8,10,8,100%<br /><br />Can practically make the menu into anything you want, using desktop wallpapers as menu image.<br />The only thing a user has to be aware of, is it draws from the top left corner, if English language.<br />Sometimes what looks like a wallpaper could look great, isn't, because wallpaper was so huge, <br />Only a small top left corner part of wallpaper image is seen.<br />The last screenshot picture is of MS wallpaper, by Adhemas Batista with your latest (not modified) skin .<br /><br />What's next color picker separators? <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I like that effect. <br />I had that effect before too in my first mod of your skin way back.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[The &quot;Main Menu Transparency&quot; settings are still a bit confusing to understand.]<br /><br />If Gaurav didn't say anything about it, leave it as is.<br />On the other hand, if you like to tinker, then different story. They can be made to have a preset grey color, similar to having the color picker enabled for a grey color. We talked about it before. I like to use real bitmaps to tweak it better, that's all. You could use all the same bitmaps you have already.<br />Just where the custom color picker is, replace with a real grey color #hex number. <br />I think it should work.<br /><br /><br />[I don't understand the default neutral grey stuff. Please explain it.]<br /><br />Same as above. If new bitmaps are used, it just overrides the bitmaps before it.<br />Don't worry about it. Just forget my blabbering. I go on and on about nothing sometimes. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br /><br />[The reset default view.]<br /><br />The picture is beautiful already. Whatever you think looks good.<br />For myself I like all white text, separators, and arrows.<br />I was just showing the &quot;1&quot; will make the option show when skin is first used, or reset.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[Touch enabled text.]<br /><br />Yes, copy and paste close to end of file.<br />You can verify if it works with Gaurav.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />[What's next, color picker separators?]<br /><br />A color picker for separators, yes. <br />Only joking, but as I said before, if you like to tinker, tinker away.  <br /><br /><br />You know that is a beautiful blurred picture. It's big too, Works for 144 DPI.<br />Because of the blur, I can fantasize it to be all kinds of things,<br />a volcano blowing its top, a colorful sunset, or even Holi festival. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Good night.

This also kept me away from the internet most of the time. I do sometimes connect but not for long. Now I am over from the work and back in action.<br /><br />So, I done a lot of changes in the Blue-ray.<br />Blue-ray has now completely different makeover. It required rewrite of code and also the re-production of bitmaps.<br /><br />Anyway, now it is done. Only thing remained is removal of bugs and glitches.<br /><br />So, Use it and reply. Especially the HIDPI Area.<br /><br />NOTE:- Currently there is not any image inside the skin file, so you have to point to an image by using option present in the setting menu, before using it. Otherwise it is not going to work.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

When I try to solve it, I realised how much work it involves. It involves adjustment of Main_bitmap mask+ Main_pattern_mask +Search_background_mask +Search_pattern_mask + Main_bitmap (for transparency mode) + Main_bitmap (for glass mode) and may be some more.<br />Then, a sudden question came to my mind- Did Gaurav mean about the highlighted numbers in the text - <span style="background-color:#00ff00;">0</span>,5,5,0 OR the central line itself.<br />So, if you mean about the number, it is easy- can be done in 5 secs Or If you mean the width of central line itself- then it requires a god amount of time. So, please tell what should I do before I do? <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />OK Thanks Gaurav for finding these. Any other recommendations? New Skin File Is Below.<br /><br /><br />And One more question Gaurav, Below are two files-one normal and one non-working. If you open non-working file in the resource hacker, you will find that all the folders' text are italics and icons and manifest files are not showing. I don't know the reason but this happens many times to me. if you know the reason please tell and how to make it working.<br /><br />And Where aaaaaare youuuuuuu Juniper? You can't escape from me by saying like in the above reply.<img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> You Have to help.<br />I am waiting for you. <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />

Confusing with same names. <br /><br />I downloaded the damaged #3 skin. Works for me with v3.6.0 Reshacker<br />Upon trying in CSM just a white default menu, unless a picture image is added.<br /><br />The power button looks unique, with the transparent border frame part,<br />just like the separators. Symmetrically placed, at least in English language. <br /><br />Looks alright. I tried some options.<br />I see so many 'select', but is there selector button color option?<br />I don't remember, was there a selector button color at one time, or was it up to user to use override glass color?<br /><br />Circle frames are different, still neat with broken part.<br /><br />Downloaded #2 good skin.<br />Ok, same thing. Only white default menu, unless click box /user picture image inserted. I see your note now. Kind of weird. Even if I change 0 to 1 in your file,<br /><br />OPTION_IMAGE PATTERN1=Select Different Image as Background,1 <br /><br />and reset skin, it still starts out CSM default white skin?<br /><br />P U. Ok, got it. Pin Unpin.<br /><br />Trying 144DPI now.<br />Maybe what Gaurav means, is due to the font used in second column is smaller, then the height of the selector button is smaller. The different font size will make width of left column gigantic, right column on skinny diet. Either leave as is, as that is your style, or increase the second and forth numbers of Main2_text_padding, or add the ,100% at end for hiDPI users like Gaurav. <br /><br />Ok, that's all I have time for. I never tried every option.<br />I would give it a pass, except for the no go default reset skin at first use. It's a bit of a turn off.<br />But you are going to fix it anyway. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Bye.

I am not the only one. If No, but Why me? This thing has ruined my skins from the start. When I nearly done all the changes, this happens and I have to start over. But afterwards I found way to tackle the problem. But It is still irritating.<br /><br />I also saw that you are using the old version of reshack. And every other one on the forum seems to use it.<br />Let me know why? I am using the latest version.<br /><br />Yeah, I was thinking about it. Is there any code for making it centred symmetrically? As when the width of second column changes, This alignment change.<br />May Be Ivo know it?<br /><br />I changed the word &quot;Choose&quot; to &quot;Select&quot;. As why should we become &quot;CHOOS - E&quot; <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />.<br />It was always like that. Selector Button Colour Option Always point to the glass colour.<br />I don't remember of adding it.<br /><br />Yeah, You are right. These things don't seem to work.<br />For example, If I add like this:<br /><br />OPTION_COLOR ACCENT=Select the Main Menu Accent Color,1,TRUE,#640000<br /><br />And we reset the skin from the settings menu, we will see that option is not enabled, instead it will be off.<br />And when we enable it, it points to #640000 color.<br />I don't know why.<br /><br />P.U. And M, M for More.<br />Do you like these?<br /><br />OK, If this what Gaurav means, then might it be corrected using 100% behind the Main2_text_padding.<br />I never tried it. Might it not work.<br />You can try it.<br /><br />Yup, I am going to add a beautiful picture when I found one.<br />May be in two or three days.<br /><br />I was thinking of removing transparent and glass option from the Main menu transparency settings as they don't look as great as solid. And Like before, Glass and transparency don't works unless a background card colour is selected. I also found a bug- During transparency and glass setting enabled, Search background is still solid. It is due to that Search_background bitmap has no transparency. This can be corrected, but it is needed only if glass and transparency settings are available. So, Should I remove them or not.<br /><br />One more question- What do you think skin has got better or worse than before?<br /><br />Bye.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Just a quick reply, for one of the issues.<br />I went back to look at good and bad file. Ok you are right. I don't really care about what the font view looks like. It can be changed anyway in Reshacker. <br />Are you going to change the icon inside for a personal one, to show up in the &quot;About&quot; box? <br />The font of Reshacker 3.6.0 stays same but icon group does not show properly.<br />Stuff like that has happened to me before too.<br />Like when I make an extra skin folder. It is usually my fault, because I targeted it to use a garbage text file. <br />I found the new Reshacker versions more complicated to use. I did not like the way its search worked. I had to make sure compile button clicked each time before search could work, and never figured out how to add images, like you have, so I just use old one.<br />The old one has a problem with transparent bitmaps sometimes. Sometimes can't replace the bitmap, until it is deleted first. Happens a lot with a user picture bitmap.<br /><br />The old Resource Hacker is here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="download/file2251.php?id=2723">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/downl ... hp?id=2723</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Enough time for one more thing.<br />[centered symmetrically]<br />Someone awhile ago, asked if every menu entry could be auto centered. They have a mock up picture.<br />Ivo said not possible.<br /><br />Still time left. OK, one more.<br />I think it was redblade8 that had a problem with user picture option showing,<br />even when put to 0 instead of 1. I think we ended up using a different name than the default &quot;USER_IMAGE&quot;. So sometimes there are work arounds that can work. Even if a tiny little 1 pixel image all that's needed for default without external picture image? <br />Bye

Whatever version works for you.<br />I would change the way you save the file. Most of time now, after clicking the compile button, I just click on the exit X of window, then it asks if I want to save, yes, save as type, select all files, highlight the file, click save, and it overwrites the file. The only problem is easy to overwrite the wrong file, and your backup just vanished.<br />Sometimes I mistakenly opened up an older file, made changes, and quickly saved, without realizing it just overwrote my newest file in a different location, because program holds onto last location of file, that program used before. <br />Enough about those embarrassment errors in my head program. <br /><br /><br /><br />[Main2_text_padding]<br />If you add ,100% <br />Main2_text_padding=7,7,7,7,100% will convert to be about Main2_text_padding=11,11,11,11<br />when at 144DPI.<br />You could do it a different way if you want exact:<br />leave Main2_text_padding=7,7,7,7 as is <br />and then add a separate text padding under the hidpi header that turns on automatically if 144DPI:<br /><br />[HIGH_DPI]<br />Main2_text_padding=11,11,11,11<br /><br />Just adding ,100% is easiest and I think tracks better for all DPI. <br /><br />That's it for today <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Accents it is.<br /><br />At first I didn't notice the borders look thinner, with border removed at bottom. <br />What I did was use your sunset mountain image from last skin, and compare. <br />The best part of your skin is the glass border when it's setup for the intermingling of the picture.<br />The default black or white look good. <br />When I put in an accent color similar to glass color looks good too. <br />Is there any way to have accent color track the glass color, like the selector buttons do, <br />maybe not same intensity though? <br /><br />My Win 10 desktop background always changing, which changes the glass/metro color.<br />Sometimes, not always, other picture images make it hard to see the colored arrows.<br />I think I like it when the arrows are same color as text.<br /><br />Now I really don't know which menu is better. <br />I like the old border thickness, but I like the new skin selector transparency.<br /><br />Just remembered, a couple spelling mistakes for the options. &quot;s&quot; is missing in Tranparent<br /><br />You can never tell who is on the internet. I could be a multi millionaire, with nothing to do sometimes,<br />or an unemployed bedridden individual with a lot of time. I do use my wireless mouse in bed sometimes.<br />I did eat a can of Heinz baked beans last night as well!<br /><br />My project. I'm changing the Bare glass skin to have less transparent white, like one of your skins.<br />Now that you showed me what a &quot;more&quot; picture is, I'm changing to a white magnifier with maybe a plus inside.<br />Ok maybe not. I guess the plus sign is for making bigger view, not more. I tried looking on internet for a &quot;more&quot; symbol.<br />All I got was bigger than sign, which looks like metro arrow. <br />I'm adding option for round selectors. Going to take awhile to do. Turning into bore chore.<br /><br />Seeya. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for that, gaurav. Now I will exit the menu before saving any changes. This saves a lot of trouble.<br /><br />One question about these padding scripts:-<br />Main_arrow_padding option is present in the skin file.<br />So, Main_split_arrow_padding will inherit from the Main_arrow_padding (as per skinning tutorial).<br />And Main2_arrow_padding will also inherit in the same way from_main_arrow_padding.<br />And Main2_split_arrow_padding will ,then, inherit from the main2_arrow_padding.<br />And Shutdown_Arrow_padding also inherits from the main_arrow_padding.<br />So, In this way, Main_arrow_padding will suffice the below three. Right or not?<br />If yes, then why we add these three padding scripts?<br /><br />Yeah, there sure is reason. Submenu arrows and separators also take color from the accent color.<br />But there is one mistake. Option should be like this &quot;Choose Menu Accent Color&quot; ,not &quot;Choose Main Menu Accent Color&quot;. I will correct them.<br /><br />OK, Bye.

You mean that is not your design?<br /><br />Yes, rectangle with round ends. To make it go a little faster, <br />I made templates that can be used over, and over with PixelFormer.<br /><br />You know I started making the split selector with a vertcal line. <br />The more I made, the more dirty they looked. I had to stop that design. They looked too porno, if you know what I mean.<br />See picture, I'm not putting that in my updated skin. I made it different now with a complete circle. <br />Now, I must have made about qty 50 so far. Then I had an idea to make a smaller circle at end. <br />It looked better, but it is too late. I have committed myself to the second version, not the third version. <br />I'm not starting over again. <br /><br />I will try your skin sometime tonight.<br /><br />I am the Master of Disaster. You know I tried playing with your now complicated skin, maybe doing same thing as you.<br />I totally wasted it. I made too many changes, (wrong changes), and killed it. It won't even start now. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />There is a point, where you have to say, &quot;That's it, no more changes, this IS the FINAL one&quot;!<br /><br />Have a good one. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi meetHG.<br />I spent some time with skin.<br />I don't know what is causing that bar at the bottom.<br /><br />Clues:<br />At 144 dpi visible as in picture.<br />If dpi reduced a little or menu height is reduced, bar goes lower. <br />Turning off search box makes it go lower, but not disappear.<br />Hiding shutdown button shows bar all the way across menu, including side borders.<br />Put internal black pattern image, looks ok, then same picture again, same problem.<br />Try a number of different external picture images. <br />Most good, 2 bad. It appears to take portion of top image and put at bottom ? <br />There has to be a 1 or more pixel height that is getting stretched with menu.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm tired now. Time to call it a day. <br />Good night.<br /><br />EDIT: Top is bottom as tile means repeat. <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />:o<br /><br />Nothing wrong with your skin. The tile just repeated itself, because it's a patterned image.<br />That was way over my head. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi Juniper, Oops somewhat late.<br />Got Some work to do.<br /><br />So, yes selectors.<br />I take a look. You wanted selectors like in the below picture earlier, but after that they don't look great.<br />Then you shifted to round selectors.<br />Well, earlier was easy to made, as we can change the slices and leave the circular edges, so that only straight portion is in the extension slice.<br /><br />Round selectors are somewhat else. We can easily setup the Slice_X, but Slices_Y will produce the distortion in the circular areas.<br />I think there is no other choice to make all the selectors for different things. But I am not sure.<br />Although one idea came to my mind, but I am not sure it will work or not. I had not tried it.<br />Well, I will take a look today.<br /><br />Bye.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I've made those types with straight sides before. Thanks for investigating.<br /><br />Round selectors will get straight sides if dpi, font, text size increased.<br />If any of the above is reverse, the shape collapses in on itself, looking terrible.<br /><br />I found out there is nothing I can do when the search box selector is used. <br />I tried adjusting the main selector slices, the best I could, but still look like rats ate it.<br />I don't think there is a separate selector for search box.<br />By the way,  <br />I finished and uploaded that project already. Thanks anyway. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />You may not hear from me for awhile.
