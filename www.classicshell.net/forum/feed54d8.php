Anyone else have this odd problem with Microsoft Edge on Win10?<br />If I resize window bigger, desktop shows through. The more I pull window, the more invisible. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Happened with Creators Update. <br />Internet Explorer, Firefox work fine.<br /><br />My opinion-Win 10 is still a baby learning to walk.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Ah! Edge works again thanks to new Win 10 Cumulative Update KB3213647<br />MS takes it away, and gives it back.

Fortunately, the game manufacturers have no loyalty to Windows 10 or DX12, and will likely still be making games that most of its PC gaming crowd can use with their Win7 machines.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this also makes it more likely that more game manufacturers won't even bother porting their games to PC anymore, which was already hard enough to get them to do.<br /><br />QuadHD, which I guess is a main thing in DX12, doesnt improve much for computer monitors as doubling the HD pixels on a relatively small screen size doesnt help to improve perceptible quality much at all, as there exists more data than the human eye can even perceive. QuadHD will do nothing at all for mobile phones or computers unless they build a way to use auto zoom, panning and snapping in for access to the real estate, rather than simply doubling the existing pixels in everything we see, leaving everything unchanged, like they did when HD came out.<br /><br />I just don't feel they know what to do with screen technology as it comes out. everything stays exactly the same size, the only thing it does for us is make everything more glossy and annoying, as if the sum of all that work making higher resolutions was simply to make things look more plastic-like<br /><br />Current Scrolling really sucks.. we should actually be able to zoom in and out on our desktops like you do in any graphics program, then zoom to cursor, or click on dynamic highlighted areas that shift, or drag the mouse to an area to fill the screen.. We should be able to have 4 or 8 full page programs open and viewable at the same time, with an adjustable resolution that lowers in quality scaleable with the needed screen real estate size you select.<br /><br />text is text whether its on 640x480 or 4K resolution. And creating 3D Graphics is creating 3d Graphics, on 640x480 or 4K.<br /><br />The only thing they've used the Resolution for is watching tv, playing games, and fingerfking apps to death.. as if it has nothing at all to do with computing..<br /><br />and nobody cares that microsack has created a new DX12 that can use 4K to make everything function exactly as it functions now, but with even more shiny glossiness<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Wed Oct 21, 2015 8:28 am</p><hr />

I suspect, and this is my fringe opinion, that MS has in fact been covertly taken over by a clandestine intelligence branch of the U.S. government, sometime after the creation of the Vista OS, or perhaps even when Gates got out<br /><br />I believe Apple was taken over when Jobbs was still alive and in control, and that he was likely with the CIA or whatever organization that little Facebook dweeb also belongs to.. and was the reason he fell sick and died, having created crap that tailors to the needs to intellectual property rights only, superseding any legal use or control by the user. good riddance to him. <br /><br />and then they put their top government programmers to work, and for the first time in Microsoft's history, were able to create an extremely stable OS in Windows 7<br /><br />whoever created windows 7 was definitely of a WAY higher caliber than the people who worked on XP.. they brought people in for Vista, and just took over for 7. <br /><br />and the 8 implementation seems to further get people and their info more online and active in daily life, and win10 seems another step in the direction that would make a lot of sense for a government agency to implement, but almost no sense for a computer company interested in the computing needs of computer users to implement. <br /><br />it really only makes any sense when viewed from a government perspective.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Tue Oct 20, 2015 7:59 am</p><hr />

It may actually be time to start creating ghost copies of Win7 with specific updates applied only.<br /><br />I think everyone needs to start making Ghost copies from this point on. Microsuck seems to be using its Windows Update to enforce its Windows 10 upgrade..<br /><br />Its natural to assume things will only get worse for Windows7 users from here on out, as they launch their campaign against us in what appears to be an all out war on 7 users, or non-10 users.<br /><br />It's safe to say things will begin to get more and more unstable with Win7 as they attempt to create reasons to move to win10.<br /><br />Hence, 7 needs to be ghosted with some fresh installs, and not installing the &quot;critical update&quot; that installs the win10 perma-spam machine.<br /><br />Everyone should have a Ghosted copy of a clean Win7 install with every update released prior to the Win10 spam machine, and then disable Updates.. <br /><br />I guarantee this is what we're going to need in the very near future. and when we do need it, the current updates will all be corrupted to include unstable code so that nobody can again find a stable Win7, as the campaign against us progresses and increases in its intensity<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Tue Oct 20, 2015 7:49 am</p><hr />

that didnt just &quot;appear&quot;<br /><br />it was covertly installed in a core update <br /><br />that might seem peachy to you, but its spam to everyone else. thats crap practice. nobody does that but crap developers and crap companies.<br /><br />you may enjoy the additional windows icon on your taskbar telling you to upgrade, nonstop, but let me assure you, nobody else does. <br /><br />you are a windows 8 guy, you made that clear when it first came out. thats great, I'm glad theres a certain group of people who love everything MS puts out, before its even put out. I suppose the developers may even expect that from the people of earth who they command and control with every line of god-code they create. <br /><br />but over here in this part of the world, where Microsack doesnt mean crap, they're just a sorry bunch of daft pricks who think they can get everyone to give up perfect OSs for crap mickeymouse OSs.<br /><br />and yes, I know a large majority of users enjoy mickeymouse BS, and even demand it.<br /><br />and I'm happy they create mickeymouse OSs for those people out there who like playing with computerstuff.<br /><br />but they need to pull their heads out of their **** if they they want to be taken seriously by any of the rest of us Windows users contemplating moving to Linux rather than be spoonfed soccermom garbage, those of us still on Windows 7, the overwhelming majority of Windows users, the people who've been on Windows 95 and XP most of their lives. <br /><br />don't pretend you're one of us because you have a Windows 7 computer somewhere, when you're an avid user of Win8 and quite giddy about Win10 and anything else Microsack does.<br /><br />MS can take its promises and shove them. and You need to wake up. Microsack didnt &quot;graciously allow users to continue using XP&quot;, ok? WE, the XP users, told Microsack to shove their BS up their ***** until they came out with Windws7. If no Windows 7, we'd all still be on XP. <br /><br />and nobody gives a hoot or a hollar what microcrap thinks they're going to have us do. WE tell Microcrap what we'll do, irregardless of the little sadsacks' megalomaniacal demands. <br /><br />Windows 7 will stand as long as we say it will stand. And it will stand until there's something we, the power users of win95, win98, NT, XP and 7, say its canonical and properly functioning enough to put our lives into.<br /><br />and no, thats not Win8, 8.1, or this Win10 spam-it-to-win-it bollox<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Tue Oct 20, 2015 7:30 am</p><hr />

An operating system has a 10 year lifespan; this is the promise made by microsoft when you purchase a copy of windows. Windows XP, was GENEROUSLY given an extra 5 years of support to (that they were not obligated to in any way) I suspect they will do the same with 7.<br />I've still got a windows 7 PC, and one with windows 8.1, and other than a little popup ASKING me if I wanted to upgrade to windows 10 for free.. It has made no attempts to upgrade without my consent...<br />Now there have been some things, I've been displeased with (the removal of widgets in windows 7 for example, when they were a key feature PROMISED to its users) No I didn't use them.. (well I did actually use 2-3 of them for a while), It was about principal.<br />And again, its unlikely that any games will require DX12 for a while (even if they support it, they will probably run in a lower version just fine) This will probably remain, as-long as windows 7 holds a sizable market share.<br /><br />Besides its never to late for microsoft to decide on porting it to 7/8, Though I suspect some fundamental reasons might make this difficult (or cause major performance issues)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Tue Oct 20, 2015 1:03 am</p><hr />

most games support older versions of direct X I believe, and especially if it a large portion of machines are forced to use that old version.<br /><br />that said, I would greatly prefer windows 8/10 on mobile devices, but what they did on 8 should have never affected the desktop experience.<br />On 10 they are actually doing things differently, and at-least detecting what type of device windows is being ran on, before feeding the touchscreen experience to the user (and even that is optional)<br />If you look into windows continuum Its quite promising. (Would I prefer it with the features and stability of 7; ofcourse, but ill take it over an android phone) The point is, its their OS, and they can take it wherever they wish (wherever the money leads) It makes me sad sure..  but i'm not going to take it personal<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Mon Oct 19, 2015 3:42 pm</p><hr />

Microsoft is purposely not bringing DirectX12 to Windows 7, eventhough its still by far the most popular Windows OS in current use, simply to (yet again) try and force people into their Win10 downgrade<br /><br />Most of us came from XP directly to Win7, and that only because it was the only viable replacement for XP.<br /><br />We remained on XP even through MS's push to get everyone off of it.<br /><br />In the end, Microsoft was so desperate to get people off of Windows XP, they actually put on a straight face for once and created a real OS, with real programming. They called in the best programmers they had available, who they normally have painting the walls and mowing the lawns apparently, and somehow created in Windows 7 what took them over a decade to complete with Windows XP, which actually wasnt really complete at all, even after SP3<br /><br />Windows 7 is their best OS to date. <br /><br />We've all suffered miserably through the countless fails and mishaps MS has created over the past 20+ years<br /><br />If they think not bringing DX12 to W7 is going to force people into W10, they can go Fk themselves. <br /><br />I would rather never buy another new game from any game company, ever. <br /><br />so, screw off game companies, I'm not paying you jack sht for your game because Im not being forced into any OS by Microsack so that they can feel they're fkd up ideas for an OS were a success. They're not. <br /><br />so, oh well.. guess I'll be using my PC for things other than games. Hence, the reason I have a PC and not a PS or Xbox, FYI<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Mon Oct 19, 2015 9:06 am</p><hr />

it should be a touch of a button interface switch from Windows 7 Pro, to some candy phone swiping yeehaw, then back. <br /><br />there was a phone that came out very briefly that went from a full OS, when shutdown, to a few basic messaging features. but your OS wasnt booted, and that was a long time ago, on like one device.<br /><br />This way, you can use your phone in Windows 7 style, as well as plug it into your home monitor for the exact same desktop experience, utilizing full versions of programs, not apps. <br /><br />Then click the corner or something and switch to an on-the-go screen, more like a functional screen-saver where you could answer calls, access messaging, play with the little cutesy mobile apps, etc. then exit the screen saver mode and get right back to the full desktop window 7 on your full HD device.<br /><br />then when connecting to your home controls that havent even been invented yet, you could launch a different screen to control your home appliances or whatever kind of Sci-fi BS nobody is even bothering to invent.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Mon Oct 19, 2015 8:46 am</p><hr />
