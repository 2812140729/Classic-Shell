Windows 10 Anniversary Update and future builds may remove Classic Shell. This is not related to the hack. If Windows 10 removes it, you can reinstall a compatible version.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sun Aug 28, 2016 3:13 am</p><hr />

I just had an issue of a similar nature (8-24-16) where the recent windows 10 update removed the software without any warning due to some 'incompatibility'. I double-checked the file signature from the download as recommended above and forced the install (windows 10 start menu destroys my workflow, it's just so distracting and obnoxious to use) and it's working just fine on a Dell XPS 13. No issues so far.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Thu Aug 25, 2016 7:23 am</p><hr />

I had problems yesterday (August 22, 2016).   I kept getting a pop up saying I needed to update Classic Shell, and I will admit we were driving and I wasn't paying alot of attention, was just trying to get some work done (I was a passenger), so clicked yet, then got stopped because an admin had to approve the upgrade.   It didn't look like either of the examples shown from the original problem, but after 3 reboots yesterday I suddenly had no internet, airplane mode was stuck in on.    I THINK this had something to do with the stupid Windows 10 Anniversary update and possibly Classic Shell being hacked as well, but in the end I had to restore my software to it's original factory standards and am now downloading all my software again.    Just wanted to mention this in case anyone else had something similar going on now.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14872">seamour</a> — Tue Aug 23, 2016 9:15 am</p><hr />

But the ultimate goal is just adding things for fun and use devices in a way they weren't intended to be used. For example, a hacker would modify the Wii so it can read PS3 games, or modify a PS4 so it can be used as a toaster, or add a WiFi card to a PS1 so you can watch YouTube through it. A hacker would never try to hurt anyone's devices or steal your information, just like a policeman would never rob a bank.<br /><br />To sum up, hacker can't have any negative connotation, as police can't have any negative connotation by definition. Sure a police can commit a crime or a hacker can commit a cyber attack like this one, but then automatically the hacker wouldn't be considered a hacker anymore, but a cyber criminal.<br /><br />It's like saying an innocent man killed a kid last night. That's exactly what we are saying. The time you kill someone, you automatically stop being innocent and you become a criminal.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2514">rambomhtri</a> — Fri Aug 05, 2016 4:38 am</p><hr />

Okay so, for anyone who needs some extra confidence, I got hit by it. I was stupid and didn't stop when the digital signature wasn't there. Though I did acknowledge it by thinking &quot;wasn't this signed last time I updated? Oh well.&quot;<br />Unfortunately for me, something else happened when I got infected. Avast, my antivirus, caused me to bluescreen due to an incompatibility with the Anniversary update on newer Intel CPUs. So even when I fixed my master boot record, I was stuck in a boot loop and had no idea what to do.<br /><br />But the only reason I discovered the boot loop is because I fixed my master boot record, and it's really easy.<br />I simply borrowed a family member's laptop to make myself a boot disk (just download the Windows ISO of your system and slap it on a disk or USB drive), used it to get into the recovery environment for Windows, opened the command prompt, and used the command &quot;bootec /fixmbr&quot;. That got me to the windows loading screen, which gave me a BSOD every time because of Avast. <br /><br />All in all, don't panic. The boot record is really easy to fix with little technical knowledge, and none of your personal files will be tampered with.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=4885">Crawfish</a> — Thu Aug 04, 2016 5:18 pm</p><hr />
