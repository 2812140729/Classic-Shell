Classic Shell 4 is a major new release for users for Classic Shell 3.6.x and earlier. Here's a more detailed list of the minor new features and changes in Classic Shell 4.0 (including new builds) compared to 3.6.8 besides the major ones Ivo mentioned above: <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />• When searching a Classic Shell setting, you can right-click on a setting and choose &quot;Locate&quot; and it will show you which tab it is on<br />• New shortcut in the Start menu to open the Start screen (Windows 8 and above). It even shows the background color of your Start screen!!<br />• Start menu animations for jumplists and fade animation for All Programs or when beginning search<br />• Start Menu in Windows 7 style can show All Programs by default if you don't want to see Recent/Frequent programs<br />• Windows 7 treeview style can show folders first <br />• New setting for the Windows 7 style Start Menu to control the height of the main menu <br />• The items in the All Programs tree can be rearranged with drag and drop, just like in the cascading menu<br />• You can drag and drop website addresses (URLs) from the address bar of all major browsers now into the Start Menu to pin them<br />• With Classic Start Menu running, the Start Screen will also open using Win key on the correct monitor with the mouse pointer<br />• Most skin bitmaps (like the user frame) now support masks and can be tinted with the glass color<br />• In HKLM version of settings, you can add “_Default” to a setting name to override the default value without locking the setting for all users<br />• You can type “none” for the label of a menu item to keep it blank (previously, &quot;none&quot; was only possible for getting a blank icon)<br />• To permanently hide a program from the Start Menu's Frequent list, use this &quot;NoStartPage&quot; method: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/284198">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/284198</a><!-- m -->.<br />• To permanently hide a Modern app or some new desktop app shortcuts from the MFU list which won't hide with &quot;NoStartPage&quot;, use this method: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378459(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378459(v=vs.85).aspx</a><br />• The search results category headers can be expanded/closed within the menu itself using Enter key or by clicking them. Clicking on the header's text (or Ctrl Enter) opens results in Explorer<br />• Support for wildcard filtering of paths in the search box e.g. C:\Windows\*.exe or %tmp%\*.log<br />• Store, PC Settings and other Modern app shortcuts from Programs folder are listed in the Apps folder on Windows 8+<br />• A new turn off monitor command that you can add to your Shutdown submenu<br />• File search can search your emails (Windows Mail, Live Mail and Microsoft Outlook) if they are indexed by Windows Search<br />• Nested settings. Dependent settings are offset from their parent and greyed out if parent setting is disabled<br />• Computer/This PC item can now show a list of drives as a menu without expanding each drive further<br />• Secondary Tiles for Modern apps show the personalized tile name and can be launched from the menu as well<br />• &quot;Install Updates and Shutdown/Restart&quot; functionality like the original Start Menu<br />• Aero Glass rendering if the MSFN member BigMuscle's AeroGlass for Windows 8 mod is installed<br />• Enhanced keyboard shortcuts like Home/End/Page Up/Page Down in addition to F2, Del, Alt+Enter etc working everywhere<br />• Shift+Win uses a hotkey instead of a keyboard hook so it will give less problems and work with elevated programs<br />• The icons and data are saved to a cache on disk at %APPDATA%\ClassicShell, so the menu should stay responsive all the time. If you don't want repeated writes to the disk such as in case of an SSD, set the Read-only attribute for the %appdata%\ClassicShell\Datacache.db<br />• Right-click for the Win+X menu works even when all corners are disabled when using the Classic Shell button<br />• New Start Menu setting for the icon size for the Classic button<br />• Classic IE9 renamed to Classic IE as it has title bar and status bar enhancements for IE9, IE10, IE11 and future<br />• The Classic Shell installer and binaries are now digitally signed so you can verify its authenticity and avoid malware which spoofs it<br />• New Start Menu setting to override the color used by the menu in its glass areas<br />• Improved support for systems like Nvidia surround and AMD Eyefinity that modify the position of the taskbar<br />• The Start Button settings are applied live and you can see a preview of the button image in the settings dialog<br />• The Windows 8.1 setting to skip the Metro screen can be accessed through the Classic Shell settings<br />• The installer uses better compression that reduces the download size by half<br /><br />• Language related improvements (See here how to translate Classic Shell: <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1344&amp;p=6973#p6973" class="postlink">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1344&amp;p=6973#p6973</a>)<br /><br />◦ Country flags in the Languages tab<br />◦ Language files can be downloaded directly from the settings to %ProgramData%\ClassicShell\Languages<br />◦ The auto-update checks for new language files<br />◦ Old language files can be used if newer ones are not available<br />◦ Currently unsupported languages can be added later<br />◦ The settings in the skins are localized (and their tooltips)<br />◦ The names of the menu commands are localized<br />◦ The Settings dialog has a place to put the name of the translator<br /><br />• Note: Classic Shell 4.0 no longer supports Windows Vista<br />• It's FREE!!!<br /><br /><strong>There is also an elaborate feature comparison available now, of Start Menus in case you are undecided whether to go with Classic Shell: </strong><a href="http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=2399&amp;p=11787" class="postlink"><strong>http://classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=2399&amp;p=11787</strong></a><br /><br />Get a matching Windows 8.1 skin here (you may have to tweak some settings): <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1186" class="postlink">http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1186</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sat Oct 05, 2013 8:57 am</p><hr />
