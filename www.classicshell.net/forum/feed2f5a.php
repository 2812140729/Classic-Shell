Hey, I couldn't tell exactly what the point of this thread was (I didn't completely understand the original post) but I believe that there may be some common points between this one and the thread I recently opened (I would have continued here but I wanted to avoid changing the topic of the thread). lpchaim, if this thread (<!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=5619">viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=5619</a><!-- l -->) looks to be the same topic as yours, you're welcome to add a comment saying you'd like the feature as well, just so everything is in one thread, if not everyone can just ignore this post. *fades into the darkness*<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12532">ChristenColour</a> — Sun Jan 24, 2016 1:14 pm</p><hr />

Hey there people!<br />I'd like to ask if there could be a way for the taskbar customisation settings (&quot;Windows 10 configuration&quot; tab) to offer different settings for the maximized window state. I'm thinking of obtaining a final look that falls somewhat along the lines of how android currently works sans the taskbar tinting (although that could be neat as well haha), as in a transparent taskbar when nothing is taking all the screen and a solid one when something is. As much as I love a fully transparent taskbar, it looks off with maximized windows.<br />I do realise this would probably be hard, if not unfeasible to implement, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.<br />Even if it can't be implemented would a way to externally access said customisation features, like from command line switches for example, be out of question? This is so something can be cooked up to serve this purpose.<br />Also, if there's something that works like this already I'd appreciate some pointers. Couldn't find anything on the web.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12062">lpchaim</a> — Wed Nov 18, 2015 1:29 pm</p><hr />
