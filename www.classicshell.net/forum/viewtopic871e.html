Currently to save my work as I go I'd have to click ok, and then reopen settings. Most programs/dialogs have a way to save what you're doing without closing the program/dialog, usually in settings dialogs this is an apply button.<br /><br />I searched and found some threads requesting an apply button before, their reasons however were not as compelling.

It will only increase the number of clicks: change some setting -&gt; Apply -&gt; open Start menu to test it.<br /><br />Also, the settings dialog is shared with Classic Explorer and Classic IE where almost all settings require re-opening the Explorer or IE window so the OK button works like the Apply button for those.<br /><br />You can get used to lack of the Apply button because the changes are all still cancellable when you press Cancel. Also you can use keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl+Enter=OK, Esc=Cancel for the Settings dialog.

Maybe the label &quot;save&quot; button would suit better than &quot;apply&quot;? There is a <strong>lot</strong> more clicks involved in rebuilding lost menu changes. There are also more clicks involved reloading the settings dialog because the only way to save changes while still making them closes the dialog unnecessarily.<br /><br />Also a close button is not a &quot;cancel&quot; or &quot;discard changes&quot; button, and it's unreasonable that it act as such. Not really sure esc should be acting that way either, at least not without confirmation.

I found the relevant dialog in ClassicStartMenuDLL.dll using res hacker but I have zero idea how to remove the close button and/or make the default close behaviour &quot;save&quot;.<br /><br />Might have a look around to see if there's a program that detect a specific dialog from a specific program and prevent it from closing with red X and alt+f4.
