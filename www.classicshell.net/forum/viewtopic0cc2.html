On the General Behavior tab, uncheck 'Start automatically for this user'. This will not start the menu when you log in. See if the hanging goes away after doing this. That will confirm if the hanging is being cause by Classic Shell or something else. Then you can turn it on again and prepare a dump.<br /><br />Also, note that is why this is a beta so please bear with bugs. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

I can't get Procdump to run. I guess things are too frozen. All I can do is click on my second monitors taskbar which will give me the message to kill Windows. Once I do that CSM comes to life.

You can also try blindly typing the command, but you have to be in the right directory with procdump first...<br /><br />As a last resort you can right-click on Explorer and save a crash dump from there. However those are pretty big. You will have to use some file sharing service to upload it.<br /><br />To get you unstuck, we can try few things in this order:<br />1) See if you can run regedit from the Task Manager. If so, go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\IvoSoft\ClassicStartMenu\Settings and create a new DWORD called &quot;AutoStart&quot;. Set it to 0. This should hopefully prevent the auto-start of the menu and let you log in. You can then manually run the start menu by running ClassicStartMenu.exe<br /><br />2) Run regedit and go to HKCR\CLSID\{ECD4FC4D-521C-11D0-B792-00A0C90312E1}. Rename the sub-key &quot;TreatAs&quot; to something else, like &quot;TreatAs1&quot;. Reboot and see of that helps.<br /><br />3) See if you can launch the installer from the Task Manager. Locate the installer and run it. Select Remove. Hopefully this will uninstall Classic Shell and bring your system back into usable state.<br /><br />There must be something unique on your system, also judging by your other problem with highlighting. We need to figure out what this is.

The problem in this post went away as did the Apps entry always being highlighted.  It was highlighted until I ran one of the Apps.<br /><br />At first I disabled all my non-MS start ups and services.  That did not work.  The Diagnostic Startup disables MS services and drivers so the problem might be with something MS.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Is this reversible? If you turn on back &quot;Normal Startup&quot; does the problem come back?<br />It will be greatly useful to identify the real cause, in case other people experience the same problem.<br /><br />If you can reproduce it again I will make another build with more logging to pinpoint the part that's failing. However the most useful thing will still be if you can manage to get a dump when Explorer is frozen. I thought of another possible way to run procdump. Put procdump.exe in some easy to find location (like C:\). Create a batch file in the same place that runs &quot;procdump explorer.exe&quot;. Run the batch file to make sure it creates a .dmp file correctly. Then you will be able to easily run the batch file from Task Manager if Explorer freezes.

If it does, use the Task Manager's Browse button to get to the Classic Shell folder and rename ClassicStartMenu.exe to something else (like ClassicStartMenu2.exe). Reboot and see if Explorer will start this time. Basically launching the start menu has two stages and I'm trying to figure out which one is the problem. Renaming the exe will disable the second stage.

Now when I start my machine I get the Metro start screen. Clicking on my Desktop tile I get thrown into the desktop and CSM starts up. <br /><br />I'll keep Vbox on my system until we fix this. I just discovered Hyper-V and might use that instead of Vbox if it suits my needs.<br /><br />**** Found a better temporary solution.  In addition to adding CSM to my startup folder I ran SkipMetroSuiteUI to bypass the Metro screen.  This works fine although CSM takes a little longer to startup compared to how you do it.

I have no clue what might be happening.<br /><br />What would really help narrow down the problem is a crash dump. Can you please try to get procdump to work one more time? Like create a batch file that runs &quot;procdump explorer.exe&quot; and that you can launch from the Task Manager while Explorer is frozen.<br /><br />As a last resort you can create a dump directly from TaskManager. Right-click on the explorer.exe process and select &quot;Create dump file&quot;. These files are big but usually compress about 2:1. If you don't have a place where you can upload it (like dropbox) I will figure something out later. At the moment it is important to create the dump file while the problem is still happening.

The Vbox problem appears to have been fixed.  The only difference I see now is the Metro start menu appears for a couple of seconds before I get to my desktop.  The previous version without Vbox installed went to the desktop immediately without seeing the Metro start screen.<br /><br />2. Permanent highlighting seems fixed.  I'll monitor this.<br /><br />3. I have UAC at the lowest setting via the slider.  In reality this does not turn UAC off completely in W8.  I believe changing a Registry entry is the only way to accomplish a complete disable of UAC.  However, this is not recommended by MS.  I've never had popups the way I have UAC off.  Could it be those that did have popups had UAC completely off via the Registry?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />By old method, Ivo means sending Win+D keystroke/show desktop command. It still uses COM to skip the Start screen right? It no longer depends on the service like 3.6.x did. Giving two options means supporting both and unnecessary complexity. Plus Windows 8.1 is coming with a native option to boot to desktop in a few months.

As there are enough reports by now to suggest it doesn't work in many cases, I'd rather remove it. Adding an option with somewhat technical description will be confusing for most users.<br /><br />And yeah, I want to see what 8.1 has to offer. The //build/ build is supposedly coming up next week.
