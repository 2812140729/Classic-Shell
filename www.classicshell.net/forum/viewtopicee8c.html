		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello !<br />firstly, thanks for this very very great program !<br /><br />I have a bug to report. Here is my configuration :<br />- Windows 8 Pro x64<br />- Computer : laptop ASUS ux32vd. Has both i7 HD4000 integrated graphic card and dedicated Nvidia 620M<br />- Classic Shell version : 3.6.5<br /><br />The first time I tried the &quot;log off&quot; function, it closed very fastly the session (despite of the opened softwares). I was impressed ! But when opening my session again, the desktop icons didn't appear and windows seemed blocked (&quot;thinking&quot; cursor, task bar blocked...). The task manager reveals that explorer doesn't respond. If I close it and run it again, it looks ok. If I restart computer, problem remains.<br /><br />&quot;Fortunately&quot;, I already had this symptom when I updated my HD4000 driver. I finally (...) discovered that I had to install the nvidia driver just after (it manages the share of graphics). So I tried here to reinstall nvidia driver to fix the problem. It works !<br /><br />Just in case, I wanted to check if a log off from windows (not from classic shell start menu) provokes the same problem : it doesn't. So it seems classic shell has a bug with the log off function. Maybe it's done too fast and this causes a crash with drivers ?<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />renArD

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your reply. Here are the results in the order of tests.<br /><br />- Log off by pressing Alt+F4 and selecting Sign off -&gt; similar symptoms as described, but not exactly. If I wait, explorer finally arrives. Restarting the computer does'nt fix either. It's still a bit longer than usual. Reinstalling nvidia driver fixes the problem.<br /><br />- Log off from the start menu : I understand by classic shell -&gt; it fails as described in my first post. I had a doubt because Alt+F4 partially works, so I wondered if waiting could be the solution but no.<br /><br />- Log off by pressing the user picture in the Metro screen. Didn't knew this way, thanks ! -&gt; I had to switch off classic shell to run Metro. It's seems to be the same symptoms as Alt+F4, altough I had cases with no recovery of the desktop.<br /><br />- Log off by ctrl+alt+suppr (not asked, but it's the way I did for my first post) -&gt; oh no I feel I'm crasy ! I'm sure there were no problem (as I said in my first post) and now it fails too <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /> By the way, trying the previous methods fails all the time now. It's as everything is getting worse ! But in a certain way it's good for you since it may not be Classic Shell...<br /><br />- Log off by running &quot;shutdown /l&quot; from the command line -&gt; same as the now unique symptom : fails.<br /><br />Well, it sounds like I disturbed you for nothing ! Sorry about that.<br />Or if there where something to find, I won't be able to do so...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />renArD

Shift+click should do it, or Shift+Win key. Another way is to use the Charms bar (Win+C) and pick Start.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />You're right, thanks for the tip.<br />I was prepared to answer something like &quot;the result is the same, as expected&quot; but it works ! It encouraged me to be more rigorous.<br />So I told myself &quot;ok, let's do it again but the system has to be similar (not &quot;reloaded&quot; after a log off) so I have to restart.&quot;. Restart is ok (maybe a little bit long), but the same test fails the second time :-/<br />Here we go : reinstall of the driver, restarts, etc.<br />I tried exactly the same (log off by metro) and it worked but it was a bit long for explorer to recover. I did not try one more since it's already abnormal.<br /><br />In conclusion, with Classic Shell it MAY be a little worse...<br /><br />PS : my tests through Classic Shell were done with the &quot;log off&quot; shortcut, not with the shutdown button and then choosing log off.
