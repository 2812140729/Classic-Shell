I restarted my computer and it is saying that it is &quot;Restoring your previous version of Windows...&quot;. I may have requested that earlier when I was looking for a fix.<br /><br />By the way, wasted about 6 hours today trying to figure this out. Even resorted to installing a new drive I had on hand to reload Windows 10. That's when I found your note about the Malware. At least Classic Shell was one of the first things I tried to load so I got the message before re-configuring everything. And it was good I kept my original drive intact instead of wiping it.<br /><br />Looks like all is in order now.

Once you fix the infected drive, you can enable them again. Windows Startup Repair might be successful with additional drives disabled.

I downloaded CS on the D, ran from D, now my D is missing.  <br /><br />I'm getting the spade and cursor on startup not the open letter.  <br /><br />I tried bootsec fix MBR as above, it says operation completed successfully but when I go back to Repair Installation it doesn't go forward.  <br /><br />Okay... Here's the thing.  It recognizes my C drive and everything on it.  But not my D.  I tried doing the Windows installation again just to see if it would work and it says my D drive has full capacity. I certainly hope that it didn't remove all the data from my D drive.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it looks like the instructions above for disconnecting the affected Drive is 4 drives that are affected that have Windows on it. My drive that is affected does not have Windows on it. Would it still work though, and should I try it, as in is it safe to try it, to disconnect my D drive, then try bootsec fix MBR, then try to repair the installation.<br /><br />Now suppose that doesn't work, and this is where I need some crucial specificity, could I just format my C drive, reinstall Windows, then connect my D drive again and everything should be fine?  Or does this virus hold itself onto the drive regardless, and when I reconnect my data will be gone?<br /><br />Also one other thing would it help to disconnect physically or is that unnecessary?<br /><br />Thanks for any of your help.

Do a quick scan using Testdisk and then add back the partition it finds and write it to disk. This should be doable with both drives connected since Testdisk shouldn't get confused between drives unlike Windows Startup Repair.<br /><br />Windows might not give you a true reading of the drive even if the data is intact if the partition table (not the MBR) is deleted/corrupted. Running TestDisk can allow you to recover that partition and make it readable again.

If you can please just link the file I need to download or the page that the file I need to download is on, right here, then I can move forward.<br /><br />Last thing, to the best of your knowledge, if this doesn't work, would it be safe for me to disconnect my D drive, reinstall Windows on the C drive, and then reconnect my D drive.  To the best of your knowledge would that work also? Or if anyone else that is reading this wants to chime in, that would be fantastic.  <br /><br />Thanks again.

It just keeps going into the Preparing Automatic Repair mode, then Diagnosing PC, then I get the 2 choices of Automatic Repair Restart of Advanced Options.  Unfortunately even tho I enabled Restore Points and had some the latest Win 10 update disabled Restore and removed the restore points so have not option for restore points in Advanced Options Restore.

It was rectified within just a few hours so it is highly unlikely that the fake malware-infected installer is still in circulation. If your PC's booting broke recently, it is most definitely by some other reason and is not related to Classic Shell. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />

Have a 26 year experienced repair person checking it out.  Malware may have loaded at same time, or more likely back sector on aging hard drive with CS installation caused boot corruption.

Yes, I did ignore the warnings because this a new computer (DEC.) and the warnings were unfamiliar. I had previously installed this program, so I thought it was Windows trying to discourage me. Oops.<br /><br />I ran my recovery flash drive and got into the Recovery screen and went to Advanced options; Command prompt; ran Chkdsk/F and got the message &quot;Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected&quot;. I ran the bootrec /fixmbr and even though it showed &quot;This operation completed successfully&quot; it didn't work. So, I found a different website that gave me something else to try.<br /><br />I went through the same steps and when I got the command prompt I ran the following commands:<br />bootrec/fixboot<br />bcdedit/export c:\bcdbackup<br />bootrec/rebuildbcd<br /><br />I got this: &quot;Scanning all disks for Windows installations&quot;.<br />Then: &quot;Successfully scanned all Windows installations. Total identified Windows installations: 0&quot;<br /><br />I ran other commands, which I didn't copy so in order to tell you what they were I would have to reconnect the computer I was using in the hopes I saved the page in Favorites. It is running Vista 64bit and I got so frustrated with it I bought an HP notebook for $239 that isn't a bad piece of equipment thus far...<br /><br />Anyway, I ran all of it and this is what I got:<br /><br />DISKPART&gt; list volume<br /><br />Volume ### Ltr Label Fs Type Size Status Info<br />-------------- --- ----- -- ---- ---- ------ ----<br />Volume 0 E DVD-ROM 304 MB Healthy <br />Volume 1 C OS NTSF Partition 918 GB Healty<br />Volume 2 ESP FAT32 Partition 200 MB Healthy Hidden<br />Volume 3 WINRETOOLS NTSF Partition 855 MB Healthy Hidden<br />Volume 4 Image NTSF Partition 11 GB Healty Hidden<br />Volume 5 D Recovery FAT32 Removable 29 GB Healthy <br /><br />DISKPART&gt; select volume 2<br /><br />Volume 2 is the selected volume.<br /><br />DISKPART&gt; assign letter-z<br /><br />Diskpart successfully assigned the drive letter or mount point<br /><br />DISKPART&gt; exit<br /><br />Leaving Diskpart...<br /><br />x:\windows\system32&gt;bcdboot C:\windows/s Z:f UEFI<br /><br />Bcdboot - boot file creation and repair tool.<br /><br />The bcdboot.exe command-line tool is used to copy critical boot files to the<br />system partition and to create a new system BCD store.<br /><br />bcdboot &lt;source&gt; [/l &lt;locale&gt;] [/s &lt;volume -letter&gt; [/f &lt;firmware.]] [/v]<br />[/m [{OS Loader ID}]] [/addlast] [/p] [/c]<br /><br /><br />That is as far as the instructions took me.<br />What did I get?<br /><br />&quot;Windows failed to start.&quot;<br /><br />That's where I'm at.<br /><br />I put in a new hard drive and installed Windows 10 Restore Media from a flash drive I got from Dell. I connected the original hard drive hoping it would act like a slave drive, but just like when I connected the original hard drive to the computer with Vista using a USB to IDE/SATA adapter: the hard drive isn't found.<br /><br />It has been 25 years since my days as a student at Control Data Institute and I've only worked with dos a few times since then. I can pull up the directory of disk X and see all the files, so it is all still there, of course, but the infection seems to have carried with some root files and I feel like I didn't go in depth enough to isolate the boot record and change it, or changing it didn't work because the infection is inside any file I'm using to change the boot record. <br /><br />If nobody has any suggestions for going forward from where I've presently gotten the hard drive to, I might try to revert it back to the original file structure in the original drive partition: if I can find the instructions I used and reverse the command directions. Then I'll probably try the Rufus or maybe Testdisk.<br /><br />I'm okay with messing with it for a while since I can't do much worse than the unusable condition it is already in.<br /><br />Should all my tinkering fail to restore the disk to bootable condition, does anybody have any suggestions on how to find my documents and photos and transfer them to a flash drive? I suppose the data isn't damaged--only the MBR--so it would be safe to extract if I can find a method for doing so.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for any legitimate replies!

They advised me to create a different one with the computer I was using that purportedly contained more sophisticated tools but even though the Windows Vista program downloaded the file, it couldn't open it so I couldn't do what the technicians wanted me to do before copying the files to a Flash drive. They submitted a request to have me sent a Windows 10 Recovery flash drive which I used to install Windows 10 on a blank 1TB hard drive.
