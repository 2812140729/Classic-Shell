I saw a picture of someone using a white background start screen for windows 8. I'm not sure where I can find it now though. Yes, I'd agree with the tiles removed it would seem more boring. xD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Thu Jan 26, 2017 3:30 pm</p><hr />

No problem.I do remember an administrative folder that if you named a new folder with a certain name, you would get the administrative folder. <br /><br />Oh. I think I got you now. The tiles disappear when you scroll. <br /><br />Only a bit of padding on the top. I'll have to try and see. <br /><br />I didn't know that the glass colors seem more grey. Hmm. I didn't even know that there was so much of a difference between the colors. <br /><br />House renovating is lots of work.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Tue Jan 17, 2017 8:44 pm</p><hr />

Hi redblade8 <br /><br />Don't bother looking for anymore links. Thank you.<br />I will use those as well as what I found on internet.<br />I found someone asking similar link questions on old Classic Shell forum.<br /><br />The answer is to go to Microsoft and get control panel items, canonical names:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee330741(v=vs.85">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/librar ... 41(v=vs.85</a><!-- m -->).aspx<br /><br />like this:<br /><br />Devices and Printers shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}<br /><br />I found out there is a special folder in the registry, that also has those types of links.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm not on Win 10 right now to make a screen shot of how the tiles disappear at bottom of real menu, when its scrollbar is moved. <br /><br />Only you know what you want on the skin, regarding the amount of padding.<br /><br /><br />I just finished making a glass color option if skin used on Win 8. <br />It looks so different switching back and forth between start screen colors and glass colors.<br />The glass colors all look more grey looking. The menu looks so dull and boring. <br />I think it's due to the default saturation level in Windows personalization control.<br />One background picture with auto color turned on, makes the tiles on my menu practically white. <br />Can't even read the fake text on it. Dang it. If I boost the color slider the white goes away.<br />I made a mistake in not making tiles original size. Looks so dinky. Too late now,<br />I'm not going back to rework them. I think I'm going to try and finish mine by the weekend, or trash it,<br />and work on house renovating instead. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Tue Jan 17, 2017 12:59 am</p><hr />

I'm not sure what happened to my post. It seems like it was cut off. Maybe hacked, not sure.<br /><br />So I have to add more padding to main2? Ok, I'll try that. <br /><br />Yes, its lucky to have a backup. I did that before I think too. I also had made a backup. <br /><br />What do you mean by it will be cutoff like the real windows 10 menu? I'm not sure what you mean. <br /><br />An emblem mask? I'm not sure how to use it. x3 <br /><br />One giant emblem could work, but I guess I'm lazy lol , and the current emblems seem to work.<br /><br />Yes, I could preset the amount of recent programs. <br /><br />Idk, I think that's a word x3. It sounds like a lot of work. <br />Ah, so that's why metro colors are different between windows 8 &amp; windows 10. Doing other things in the meantime sounds good. I made a start menu in the meantime of a html project I had. <br /><br />I could help, but I'm not as good as you are with .skin making. x3<br /><br />Thanks for complementing me saying I'm computer savvy. ^-^ <br />I'm so so I'd say. <br /><br />I could try to find the direct links for those, yes. I'll take a look a bit later for you.<br /><br />Here is disk tidy: c:\windows\system32\cleanmgr.exe<br /><br />I looked in c:/windows/system32, but I didn't find any others. <br />I searched for ie.exe in c:/windows, and found ieexplore.exe in c:\windows\winsxs\wow64(very long file name here)<br /><br />Internet explorer is also in c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore.exe<br /><br />Will look again tomorrow for more.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2017 6:16 pm</p><hr />

I was away for a few days, I have to make it up with lots of text, with bad spelling, and grammer included.<br /><br />Hi redblade8.<br />I don't think the user picture info needs to be added again, unless it is different.<br />Hmm. Guess there is something different. <br />The User_frame_position is missing the &quot;-&quot;, so it puts the picture on left side.<br />Yes that could work too. <br />Would have to increase top padding on left column of Classic 2 style, and bring the name over too. <br />Unless it was a mistake?<br /><br />I made a big booboo on my skin. A couple days ago, I started to play around with your skin.<br />I was tired, day dreaming, on autopilot mode. When I saved mod of your skin, I wasn't looking where it saved it.<br />It overwrote my skin, coz program remembered the path from before. I was so lucky. I had made a backup an hour before.<br />It's very dangerous switching back and forth between different modded skins. <br /><br />Back to your skin. If you still want the user picture on right, with extended emblems,<br />anything larger than menu will be cut off like Win 10 real menu.<br />You could always add an emblem mask for the emblems so emblems get cut a small distance before taskbar, like a border.<br />This emblem mask can control where the emblems show, or not show. <br />I'm not talking about an emblem mask on top of the emblem to control color on the emblem, because there is no such thing.<br /><br />Speaking of emblems, if you go that way with emblems as tall as monitor height, and don't mind the look of them cut off,<br />why not just use one giant emblem?<br /><br />Moving the &quot; COLUMN PADDING &quot; in the Customize tab, can push the space around the entries.<br /><br />Everyone uses different amounts of jumplists, and recent programs. For me 5 or less is good enough.<br />Could always preset amounts for xml file.<br /><br />As for my skin, I kind of lost interest. Got bogged down by the enormousity of it.<br />I don't think that's a word, but for sure, my skin is becoming enormously complex.<br />When I went on Win8.1, it's crazy. My skin has metro colors. On Win8.1 the desktop uses aero glass colors, not metro. <br />Metro colors work from the start screen, and there are no accent metro colors, because Win 10 invented after.<br />So to get a metro color, have to switch to start screen, adjust color, switch back to desktop. <br />As far as I know, auto color desktop picture, does not work on the metro colors, <br />so I think I will have to make a simple glass color option just for Win 8.1.<br />Too much, that's why I'm taking it easy, doing other activities.<br /><br />If I ever finish mine, maybe you could help me towards the end?<br />A number of the links I have as buttons, were made from shortcuts that I made and stored in my computer.<br />If I upload skin for other people, the links are not going to work.<br /><br />I'm not computer savvy, but I think you might be, because you were on the forum from years ago.<br />Commands and executable strings mean nothing to me, Ivo has put lots of commands, and links in the Customze section.<br />I can't find all the ones I want to directly work, that apply the icon as well. <br />I checked Winaero, Rainmeter site, other forums, for direct commands/links, can't seem to figure it out.<br /><br />Would you happen to know direct links for all these? <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> : <br /><br /><strike>Internet Explorer</strike><br /><br /><strike>Default programs</strike><br /><br /><strike>Devices and Printers</strike><br /><br /><strike>Programs and Features</strike> found it <br /><br /><strike>Disk Cleanup</strike> Thanks <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br /><strike>Defender</strike><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Sun Jan 15, 2017 10:21 am</p><hr />

Hi, I tried doing [NOICONS AND SMALL_ICONS AND (USER_PICTURE OR USER_NAME)]<br />User_frame_position=10,6<br />User_name_position=10,10,-54,40 <br />And then the text for the emblems. I don't have to specify the user_frame and user_name then?<br /><br />The adding more emblems to new space with lots of recent programs sounds good. I'm not sure how to make classic shell add more emblems if there is more space. Like 10 recent programs = 4 emblems, 20 recent programs = 5 emblems.<br /><br />I did have the emblems aligned by the top, but I didn't want them to move when more recent programs got added, so I made it aligned to the bottom.<br /><br />How do I make the space that has 'programs, documents, settings, find, help, and run' to stay at the bottom? It looks like it is pushed up to the top with many recent programs, leaving a big space between 'run' and 'logoff'. <br /><br />Lol at the commandments. I had forgotten about that. xD<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Fri Jan 13, 2017 8:04 pm</p><hr />

I'm not too swift with logic.<br />All I know is some headers can work without the TWO_COLUMNS added, and some don't.<br />If a header is put somewhere higher, it might get overridden with a similar header further below.<br />I even encountered a non functioning header, because I combined two options, that did not have the separate option header above. <br /><br />Ivo made a feature where there can be no icons in first column, and icons in second column, or vice versa.<br />Maybe that could screw it up? <br /><br />But normally, NOICONS (NO_ICONS in other skins) is really only for second column, so as long as you made a header that has everything<br />included like [(USER_NAME OR USER_PICTURE) AND NOICONS AND SMALL_ICONS AND TWO_COLUMNS]<br />it should work. Oh, and have it at the very bottom too. <br />If it does not work, I can look at skin tomorrow and try different ways.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Thu Jan 12, 2017 1:12 pm</p><hr />

So emblems are pictures that can't have a mask, or stretch. <br />The tint feature, the tiles changing color and having them integrated into the start menu sounds cool. <br />I'm not sure why Microsoft decided to have different metro colors for windows 8, and windows 10. If your skin can work on windows 7 too that'd be awesome. <br /><br />I meant the options for the tiles, like 80%, 40% , and no tiles. I didn't mean links, but I'm also not sure how to do them.<br /><br />Sounds good so far, the picture helps see what you want to do with it.<br /><br />Update, I made the start menu work with small icons, and with no icons. Though I'm not sure why the emblems don't move for two columns [small icons and noicons]<br />I have the new start menu attached with a XML file too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2017 5:42 pm</p><hr />

I don't think there can be a color mask for emblems, where the emblem changes color.<br />Emblems are made to not stretch.<br /><br />The tiles are integrated into the main menu bitmap, using Ivo's tint feature.<br />Then the Metro colors will change the tile color as well. My menu is only going to work on Win 10.<br />I will have to explore if it works at all, on Win 8 later. Metro colors are not the same on 8.<br />The second column entries are set to buttons in Customize tab.<br />Selectors and text are made to fit exactly in the right places.<br />I'm using the fake text as an emblem.<br /><br />Not too sure what the last sentence means. If it's the no tiles option, it will still be button view,<br />showing only the icons, and fake text.<br />If it's about incorporating linked tiles into your Win98 skin for next revision, go for it. <br />Just not sure if double width tiles can work though.<br /><br /><br />Here is a picture of a couple parts. <br />It looks like someone opened the window, with text floating in the night air.<br />Hurry up, and close the window, the text are getting in. <br />One more.<br />I don't do windows, I only do tiles. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />They are burnt in, or embedded into bitmap. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />That's a thought. A simpler glass color version could be made to work on Win 7. <br />Will leave for others, maybe you. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2017 3:48 pm</p><hr />

Thanks. I was starting to wonder if I could do [noicons and not main_emblem1]<br />I'll try out those new settings for noicons, and see how it goes.<br /><br />That sounds like a lot of work to do. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />You can have up to 10 emblems, so some of them will be bitmap png's?<br />The using old start menu skins sounds like a good idea also the options for the tiles is a good idea too.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Wed Jan 11, 2017 2:39 pm</p><hr />

Looks good.<br /><br />Well, you just mentioned the options that affect it.<br />Just make a new option header like below with emblem different numbers, that you set for proper height.<br /><br />[(USER_PICTURE OR USER_NAME) AND NOICONS AND TWO_COLUMNS]<br />Main_emblem1=53<br />Main_emblem1_padding=12,10,7,220<br />Main_emblem1_alignH=right<br />Main_emblem1_alignV=bottom<br />Main_emblem2=54<br />Main_emblem2_padding=12,10,7,116<br />Main_emblem2_alignH=right<br />Main_emblem2_alignV=bottom<br />Main_emblem3=55<br />Main_emblem3_padding=12,10,7,12<br />Main_emblem3_alignH=right<br />Main_emblem3_alignV=bottom<br /><br /><br /><br />On mine, the menu images start to add up.<br />To get transparent, opaque, trans with user picture, opaque with user picture, <br />and HiDPI versions of same types, equals 8 bitmaps (really png to reduce size). <br />I'm going to modify two of my failed attempts, and use those as well.<br />Going to be 80% tile size, 40% tile size, and no tiles.<br />Lets see that's going to be minimum 17 menu images to make! <br />The other to do part is all math measurements to align all the fake text, <br />and selector tile links to look and work seamlessly. <br /><br />Yep, taking it a bit at a time. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Tue Jan 10, 2017 11:34 pm</p><hr />

Hi, I loaded the new .skin, and it works pretty good. Everything seems ok. The tiles look a lot better now too, thanks.<br /><br />I've attached a new .XML file to this post for the mod skin, and I renamed your mod skin &amp; put a new XML file to my first post. <br /><br />It turns out that the XML file wasn't working anyways &amp; loading the white no skin menu because of one line in the XML file. I had &lt;SkinC2 value=&quot;Classic-Skin-10rev7&quot;/&gt; instead of just 'classic-skin-10'.<br /><br />Here's a picture of the start menu with the user picture, and username set up. It seems to display correctly. Only the 'no-icons' in the second column the user picture &amp; username is overlayed  on top of the emblems, which isn't good.<br /><br /><img src="http://i63.tinypic.com/wlt2xh.png" alt="" /><br /><br />Slow but steady for the windows 10 menu you're working on then. <br />Cheers! =)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1899">redblade8</a> — Tue Jan 10, 2017 10:18 pm</p><hr />

Please test the modded skin.<br /><br />I changed USER_IMAGE to USER_PICTURE and NO_ICONS to NOICONS in hopefully all the right places.<br /><br /><br />Seems to work for me. I think some settings for the emblem require adjusting if picture and name shown.<br />Tiles get in the way.<br /><br />If I try the xml file, CSM switches to no white skin. I Think you need to set it all up again and save a new xml.<br /><br />I cleaned up the noisy tiles. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />About my 10 skin. One step forward, two steps back. Slowly getting there. <br />My skin is going to still take one or two weeks more to figure out everything.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=856">juniper7</a> — Tue Jan 10, 2017 4:03 am</p><hr />
