The thing is your &quot;good enough&quot; is not good enough for most people. For the start menu to operate correctly it needs to install a service, which requires an administrator. The rest of the Classic Shell features also require admin access because they install shell extensions.<br /><br />It is pretty much accepted that on Windows you need to be administrator to install software.<br /><br />While it is possible to create a portable version that kind of works, it is not supported and you are pretty much on your own.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Ivo</a> — Sun Mar 10, 2013 2:45 pm</p><hr />

The fact that you need administrative access to install classic shell can be a problem.<br />The other day I went to my Grandma's to install classic shell on her new computer for her. (she has windows 8 and couldn't figure out how to log off or shut down) However I couldn't install it because my cousin was the only person who had an administrator account. (it was password protected and he was at work) Fortunately I was able to take a copy the instillation from my laptop I had on a flash drive and copy it on to her pc. I put classic start menu in the startup folder and it works good enough. (there's a little delay before it starts and it can't skip the start screen) A nonadministrative install option or portable version would help when  there's just no way to give administrative approval.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=277">Imold</a> — Sun Mar 10, 2013 2:32 pm</p><hr />
