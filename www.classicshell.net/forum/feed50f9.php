Hi I'm new here and I'm not sure if I'm posting to the right section but I will take a chance. I have a problem installing classic shell. I had it installed on my windows 10 creators 1709 version of windows 10 from a store bought disk. and it installed fine. However I noticed just yesterday that My skins were all gone in the software and I could only use the default sao I uninstalled the software from the iobit uninstaller. and it also deleted other entries for this software only. and then I went to your website and downloaded a fresh copy of classic shell and I got an error that said the windows installer has encountered an unexpected error installing the package this may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2503 I went into the windows services and the windows installer service was not running at first and then I hit start and it was running after that set to manual and everything else in the windows installer service is greyed out so I can only have it running at manual. And when I restart the computer it is still running. I also downloaded a program from the Microsoft store and that uses the windows installer and it installed fine.  So I think it's a problem with your software.<br /><br />Any help would be great I can't stand the windows 10 start menu<br /><br /><br />Steven<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=31066">Kinnyr90</a> â€” Wed Feb 21, 2018 11:16 pm</p><hr />
