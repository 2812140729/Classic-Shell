If they have to remove the item from the tree instead of clicking on a checkbox, it will then be much harder to recreate the item if they want it back.<br /><br />That's why the most common menu items have both a tree item (to show where the item will be in the menu and with what options), and a separate setting to enable/disable it.

Although by default, all the built-in items can be added once to the left column and disabled/enabled appropriately from Special Items tab so it eliminates the user adding to add and position items. He can just disable/enable them or show them as link/menu.

(so those could just be removed)<br />- IF you wanted you could add a 'sort by: X,Y,Z radio button option to the Edit menu Item window, since it is applicable to everything that opens as a menu (it could gray out when 'dont expand' is checked); and remove any sort-by options from the Special items tab<br /><br /><br /><br />@ the coding side of things; that's a different story.... but id like to think its only a moderate amount of work

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The goal is to provide easy UI for people who don't want to deal with per-item customization. They want a quick set of checkboxes like they are used to on Windows 7 or 95. Think of it like the skins - with the skin options you can turn on/off individual features but if you want more control you have to pop the hood and edit the DLL.<br /><br />Either way, this is mostly theoretical because for backwards compatibility I can't change the current design.

(the only tab i would absolutely not use the program without)<br />but i guess there are a lot of people using classic shell with the stock experience <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, and the customize start menu tab was a little confusing at first, even for me...<br /><br />so removal of anything from the special items tab wont work because of compatibility<br /><br />so how about just adding &quot;hide/show menu item&quot; to the context? (not asking if you will, but more of would it work fine, when it comes to compatibility?)<br /><br />none of these 'features' are high on my list of things i really want done, it was more of just a design/thought removing the contradictions <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />so if you did decide to add em to your to-do list, i hope its somewhere near the end <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />i figure with compatibility, adding stuff is generally  fine, but removing/changing isn't? am i right?
