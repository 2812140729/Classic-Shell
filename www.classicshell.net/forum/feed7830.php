Agree with your every word Tenzen. MS don't get that people use their technology for different purpose and if you actually want to <strong>work</strong> on your computer, you need something clear and straightforward, no clutter.<br /><br />Thank goodness for ClassicShell.

1. Bigger area (more space) available for pinning by expanding horizontally <br /><br />This is great, if in fact in can get bigger than Classic Shell, such as having 3 or 4 columns, but I doubt it, just voted for this because more space is always better.<br /><br /><br />2. Organizing pinned items into Groups<br /><br />Not interested at all in letting Windows figure out how to group things, I'd rather do it all myself, like I can do in Classic Shell - No Vote<br /><br /><br />3. It shows &quot;Recently installed&quot; app <br /><br />Hasnt windows done this since forever, by highlighting the new apps? I dont see how grouping them will improve things much - No Vote<br /><br /><br />4. Can uninstall apps by right click <br /><br />This would be great, provided it completely wipes the program from the system, scorched earth, I'll vote for this, because like Jothki I, too, find need to uninstall everything, particularly when the installed programs become more malicious than they originally were, via updates, or don't perform as promised or expected, or are just secretive or tricky or anything else<br /><br /><br />5. Alphabetically sorted app list with clickable/tappable letters<br /><br />I don't get this, its already alphabetical in the programs list. Alphabetical sucks imo, I much prefer the quicklaunch, putting icons where they go based on use and my own criteria, rather than random letters <br /><br />I have lots of little programs installed, that I need installed, that I rarely ever need to use, I dont want them popping up every time I want to access something I use daily - No Vote<br /><br /><br />6. Live Tiles <br /><br />Hate tiles and want them to die an awful death - No Vote<br /><br /><br />7. The Windows 10 menu can search EXE names of program shortcuts and do approximate string matching<br /><br />If this means indexing I'm definitely against this crap - No Vote<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=359">Tenzen</a> — Mon Nov 09, 2015 9:28 am</p><hr />

The clickable letters were one of the primary reasons that I gave up on the Windows 10 start menu and switched back to Classic Shell. I'm hoping that at some point Windows 10 lets you not have them.<br /><br />Right click uninstallation was kind of nice, although the fact that I found it so useful says something in of itself.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=10889">jothki</a> — Sun Aug 23, 2015 6:03 pm</p><hr />

It is a fair comparison because you should basically know whats in your start menu without labels.. <br />yes labels add more information, but In my opinion it is redundant if they have a good icon... (and I personally prefer the feel of a menu without labels, and 4-6 columns)<br />and they still have scroll-over text.<br /><br />I agree that the difficulty to change them is undesirable... but it is still possible, and something I am willing to do to get the menu I like (not that Im leaving classic shell for windows 10's default)<br />Givin easily recognizable, and color coded tiles however, I simply find it easier to find what I need<br /><br />I even prefer tiles over 'icons' because of their professional appearance (The distinction I would make is the background image being mostly covered, and a unified square theme)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sun Aug 16, 2015 9:28 pm</p><hr />

Yes but small tiles don't show any text label so that is not a fair comparison to a menu item.

I would argue that small tiles, dont take up much space, and in-fact are less space consuming than a menu item in 1-2 rows (since you get 8 columns)<br /><br />Also I would agree with you on live tiles, and was going to post that in my response but decided not to <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Not that I dont enjoy widgets, and rainmeter.. they serve a totally different purpose..

I also feel live tiles are just a gimmick to draw the user's attention for promotional purposes. There is already the notification area in Windows since forever if the OS really want to inform something. Don't need more ways to do the same thing.<br /><br />I don't think mixing touch and keyboard/mouse driven interfaces is a good idea. Tiles are good for touch. For mouse, they take up so much space. I hate scrolling due to excessive space taken by huge, oversized UI elements.<br /><br />Another issue I have with the implementation of tiles in their Start &quot;menu&quot; or the Start screen is that they don't support keyboard accelerators at all! In the Windows 10 Start Menu, even arrow key navigation is poor and keyboard indicators are horribly designed!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Sun Aug 16, 2015 6:55 am</p><hr />

I feel that live tiles are mostly just a waste of processing power. (for example, does the 'xbox' tile really need to be animated, or is it just a way for Microsoft to steal your attention...) I would understand its use for something like weather, or unread emails (but I feel that is better integrated into cortana anyways)<br /><br />I would say that I love tiles in general, both from a visual, and a functional point of view.. (I seem to be able to find what Im looking for quite quickly, even with 40~ tiles)<br /><br />Its nice to have a direct list of newly installed programs, because this allows you to organize, and pin what you want without having to search for it.<br /><br />I do like the idea behind uninstalling directly from the menu, however I feel it shouldn't be so easily accessible.. because re-installing isnt (especially if whatever program doesn't preserve all your previous settings on uninstall) Maybe a power-user option like holding control, while right clicking to add an 'uninstall program' option to the context menu (similar to how windows adds a &quot;open command window prompt here&quot; when you hold shift and right click in a folder, or on the desktop)<br /><br />I really like the idea behind continuum and having your phones layout sync with your computer, creating a truly unified experience<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sun Aug 16, 2015 6:22 am</p><hr />
