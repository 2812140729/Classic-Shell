Of course only after I put some serious intellectual investment into it? even though it only ever had a 2% market share?  Makes me a bit puzzled why they want to turn Windows experience into Phone App Store land.<br /><br />Gone are the days perhaps.<br /><br />BEOS never made it, either way- I WILL try the NEW Classic Shell for the Anniversary edition.<br /><br />Lucky me- since I bought the RETAIL version of Windows 8.1?   As of July 29th - although I'm upgraded already? If I ever DO have to rebuild ? ONLY OEM can continue to get the Windows 10 upgrade.<br /><br />So, long story short, had I not repaired the MBR? and lost quite a bit of dev work? I would have had to BUY Windows 10, all because of this pesky group that has nothing better to do than make peoples lives more difficult-  The CultOfRazor etc.<br /><br />Whoever did this, is not welcomed in any emerging global society until they change their ways.<br /><br />The hack I mean.<br /><br />So SAD it happened to such a wonderful product, let alone it's users also on the DAY that most people would be saying 'hey - What's this Windows Anniversary update ? WHERE'S MY CLASSIC SHELL? ' - to which they went and downloaded it.<br /><br />Fingers crossed I don't have an MBR virus lurking, I will have to explore deeper forensics and will certainly update pending what I find if there is more damage than JUST the MBR being wiped.<br /><br />Again Admin - thank you for the very prompt update.<br /><br />Do post a link if you can for a 'safe' download, I did read what you said about signatures, but I wouldn't know a real one from a fake one at first glance- and something tells me the culprits who did this probably read the forums and will be adding a fake signature - uh oh- my Explorer /Windows background is flashing as I write this - augh!  That normally happens with a silent install going on- I better hit Send before my system crashes.<br /><br />Tragic though, I do wonder though if it's in the 10,000's or 100,000's of classic shell users who only know - they get a blank screen with that 'spade' bottom left and the blinking cursor wondering, what happened?<br /><br />All those people who will just re-install- lose all their family photos etc, projects from their work - just sad...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14485">tim miltz</a> — Tue Aug 02, 2016 8:30 pm</p><hr />

Maybe this news should be placed on the homepage aswell as a link to the forum posted fix? not everyone even knows the forums exist, or how to find the right post. I know it looks bad to post a big 'site was hacked; right on the homepage, but for a week or so it should probably be posted<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Tue Aug 02, 2016 7:38 pm</p><hr />

Here's what happened.<br /><br />The download mirror service called FossHub, where Classic Shell stores its downloads, got hacked earlier today. This was intended to coincide with the release of Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which would cause many people to have to download the latest Classic Shell.<br /><br />The installer got replaced with a malicious software that corrupts your MBR (which is where the PC stores its drive information).<br /><br />As soon as the hack was reported, I replaced the download links with clean ones.

I figured I'd create a thread on this, as this was the cause of my system never rebooting.<br /><br />It seems according to another user in the forums the Classic Shell download links were misdirected or somehow included this virus.<br /><br />Your machine will boot up with a 'spade' character bottom left at startup - and a flashing cursor - nothing else<br /><br />While I am not sure what OTHER damage exists to my Windows 10 installation after installing the latest Classic Shell?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I bought the retail version of Windows 8.1, so I can NOT upgrade if I choose to do a complete clean install.<br /><br />I COULD argue that ClassicShell and this breach of security has cost me the price of Windows 10, which is what I now have to buy if I want to do a clean install.<br /><br />Could someone from Class Shell dev team please follow up on this thread and my other one?<br /><br />I would like to know just what happened here.<br /><br />Post Windows Anniversary update I went to re-install Classic Shell and my machine crashed, never came back.<br /><br />The screen shot this group called Cult of Peggle shows is EXACTLY what I see, and the LAST thing I did was install classic shell.<br /><br />Unfortunately I am not sure I can trust ClassicShell ever again.<br /><br />I have never had my master boot record written over by hostile software.<br /><br />The WORST I expected was maybe it wouldn't work with Windows 10.<br /><br />Classic Shell NEEDS to address this problem very fast and ASSURE users it is safe.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14485">tim miltz</a> — Tue Aug 02, 2016 6:48 pm</p><hr />
