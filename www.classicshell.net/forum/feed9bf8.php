I would just say add a max menu open delay this way the menu will open at the specified time regardless of whether the button animation is completed or not (whats wrong with the button still playing the animation after the menu has opened?) also Id still like to see an animated inactive state, and a hover loop IE if you left your cursor on the hover, it could continue to flash<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Sat Apr 04, 2015 2:26 pm</p><hr />

ahhh,<br /><br />that explains a lot.  so i guess the options explained above that limitation section are place holders?  the tutorial makes it seem like you can control the animation between all states.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Apr 04, 2015 11:20 am</p><hr />

hi,<br /><br />i recently made my first start button, it was an animated one.  i was able to figure most things out, however, i'm having trouble with one thing.  i was able to get the button to rotate from normal to hot and hot to normal.  but when i wanted to also have it rotate between hot to pressed it would not work.  i followed the instructions the best i could but no luck.  if you can shed any light on how to get a button to rotate between hot and pressed, i would appreciate it.  the tutorial i'm following is at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net/tutorials/buttontutorial.html">http://www.classicshell.net/tutorials/b ... orial.html</a><!-- m -->.  it seems to work up until hot to normal states.  when i add animation controls past that nothing is happening.  so if you imagine an analog clock or car wheel for instance.  just having either rotate clockwise, as examples.<p>Statistics: Posted by Guest — Sat Apr 04, 2015 10:15 am</p><hr />
