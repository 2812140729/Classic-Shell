This shows the new feature, emblems. <br /><br />A picture can be seen here:<br /><img src="../../i64.tinypic.com/25gyrt2.png" alt="" /><br />I've attached the .skin7 to this post.<br /><br />Credits go to:<br />Ivo - for his awesome program.<br />Jcee - for help on padding, and guideance<br />Juniper7 - for help with resource hacker, and skin text<br /><br />Edit: Version 2 is now out. It fixes the padding for the search pane, and the jump list. It seems to have the same column 1 bug though as Jcees skin though.

Thanks.<br />For the future, who knows if links get implemented?<br />All comes down to MS. If they want to release some code, or be selfish, <br />and force others to work a year or more reinventing similar code for links, live tile.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your input, it's much appreciated. ^^ It's definetly better than my first one, thanks! =) You're right about jump view and search being stretched. At first I wasn't sure what the jump view was, but it's in the first column for items with arrows on them.<br /><br />I was thinking not to go the Microsoft way for live tiles. We could be waiting ages for that xD<br /><br />We could instead have links that work exactly like under 'customize start menu' and clicking on the 'icon' then filling out 'command' , which would work.<br /><br />See my post here:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic9935-2.html?f=13&amp;t=5277">viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=5277</a><!-- l --> for more ideas. If you search for Nintendo, it's there. Or if you want I could post it here.<br /><br />I was also thinking that emblems could have a state to them like the start button does, like if we were to have a hover state, or/and possibly animated too.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hello redblade8. <br />I donno.<br />Here is way I see it. May be a bit negative.<br /><br />From looking at the Home page, this is Ivo's project. <br />Gaurav Kale &amp; Jcee do testing, forum help, recommendations, <br />with a lot of other support people to do language translation.<br />It's not a business. Just volunteers.<br /><br />I'm half guessing what happens. <br />Ivo would look at the feasibility of implementing features like you suggested. <br />To spend time to research the information, study, develop into something useful for a large proportion of users. <br />If a lot of people ask for it, priority goes higher. <br />I've come back to this site for I guess, around three years now. <br />From reading people's comments, there are a lot who want the old &quot;classic&quot; way, <br />and don't want to have anything to do with 8-10 start menu.<br />As each year went by, I saw a shift, for newer Windows features.<br />It's mind boggling how many feature/options there are now.<br /><br />It might still be an uphill climb for the features you ask? <br />Only Ivo knows. He's the brains behind all the coding. <img src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br />There is only one of him, compared to Microsoft teams of software engineers.<br /><br />Do any start menu companies offer the features you want?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Here's the thing: Links would probably be fairly easy to add to emblems; and it would be useful enough. however its highly unlikely that many users will use emblems in the manner you are suggesting (as tiles), because its simply too complicated for most users to even edit a .skin in reshacker. and requires considerable work to setup. (also there is currently a limit to 10 emblems, and i suspect they are hard-coded)<br />Something like custom shut-down and restart buttons would most likely be the primary use.. (though its a feature I would like to see implemented)

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Hi, thanks for your replies, it's much appreciated. <br />I put a lot of work into my replies, maybe too much sometimes. I like to throw everything that I think of out there &amp; try to look for input. I do understand that this is Ivo's project, and that he is a one man army as Ive said before too. I've always been a supporter of Ivo, since 2010. I consider him a friend. I remember the old forums on sourceforge, and talking to Ivo on sevenforums.<br /><br />I didn't say that this wasn't Ivo's project though, or that it was a business, which it isnt. I agree with you. <br /><br />I didn't mean that links would or wouldn't be added , but I was just saying 'if'. So I'm not sure, I was just throwing things out there. I don't expect them to be added either. I didn't mean anything bad by it. <br /><br />I'm actually in the vote of having the old &quot;classic&quot; way, and am actually a big supporter of that too. I just like the windows 10 tiles look on the start menu. If you look at my screenshot above, I have a windows 98 start button, a classic windows 7 taskbar, and a windows 10 looking start menu, all on a windows 8 os. xD I guess I like taking the best of each os.<br /><br />There is currently a program on think pads right now that gives the classic theme for windows 8, and 10. I'm hoping that there will be a final release, but I might have to use stardock windows blinds instead. <br /><br />Youre right about classic shell being the best. I dont think any start menu company out there comes close to the current classic shell, even when it was just starting out it was still better.<br /><br />Jcee, I agree with you that editing a skin for the start menu isn't just the average users thing to do. I don't think the average user would want to go through all the trouble of using resource hacker just to make a windows 10 tile emblem start menu.<br /><br />It could be used for a custom shutdown, restart, or log off button though.<br /><br />Thanks again for your replies! ^-^

It reminds me of when I was trying to figure out how to make a layer transparent, but it wasn't working. I just had to delete the layer underneath to make it transparent. <br /><br />Nice start menu splitwirez. You made that with classic shell? <br /><br />I made a new start menu with new padding text as suggested. I'll attach it to my first post.
