As things stand, one is responsible for making a button that is essentially an all-in-one product that works out of the box without additional customization and configuration (minus sizing). If Classic Shell were altered so that all one had to do is make the image file used as a button, then configure it to work using the Classic Shell interface, then you're basically forcing people who download your button to replicate those same configurations themselves in Classic Shell in order to get the button to work on their end. For the less savy or willing users, this may be a bridge too far and lead to a lot of problems.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9597">Situla</a> — Sun Apr 12, 2015 12:30 am</p><hr />

What you are suggesting is replacing the 'on-hover' animation with an 'on-click' It has been suggested by several to add an 'on-click' animation that plays after the button is clicked, in ADDITION to on-hover.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62">Jcee</a> — Fri Apr 10, 2015 5:05 pm</p><hr />

<strong>The button now features a Pressed State frame</strong>. <br /><br />Wasn't quite sure what kind of Pressed State look to go for so I ended up making three versions. Choose from the attached files below and decide for yourself which, if any you like. The pressed state in the first file simply features an inverted colour scheme. The second features an altered colour palate which I personally think looks more complimentary than the inverted colours. In the third I changed all of the faces to solid white and then made them slightly transparent so that when you click the button the faces take on the colour of your task bar.<br /><br />If anyone desires a different type of pressed state, let me know and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />Edit: also, just for the sake of clarity, the button is configured tp display the first frame by default and then transition through to the second last frame when the mouse hovers over the button. Clicking the button will display the final frame.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9597">Situla</a> — Wed Apr 08, 2015 7:01 am</p><hr />
