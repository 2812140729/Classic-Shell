From reading around, and generalizing from seemingly related posts . . .<br /><br />It looks like this only affects users who try to reclaim disk space after the update, by either running Disk Cleanup w/System Files (including Windows Update), or by running DISM /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup . . . and apparently not 100% of the users who do that experience the problem.<br /><br />The only fix to get rid of the error message is to re-install Windows, and then, don't do any cleanup, and maybe, don't do a couple of updates . . . but, this could also be a bogus DISM error message:<br /><br />Here are excerpts from what I found:<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />[I think this is wrong about KB2919355, or at least, won't work 100% of the time for everyone, but it got me to look into KB2919355 - and, possibly, it's bad advice about recommending to &quot;cleanup&quot;]<br /><br />DISM /restoreHealth failes with error: 0x800f081f . . . Now, you can go to Windows Update and install a batch of updates. Eventually, the KB2919355 update will show up and it should install fine . . . You should then be able to perform a disk cleanup w/system files including old windows versions and windows update files to reclaim disk space . . . Afterwards, you should be able to run DISM /online /cleanup-image /analyzecomponentstore . . . If it recommends cleanup (it probably will), run DISM /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup . . . You will gain tons more of disk space. I ended up doing this repair install twice, once on a test drive and the other on my &quot;real&quot; drive. Worked like a charm both times . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.eightforums.com/performance-maintenance/44172-dism-restorehealth-failes-error-0x800f081f-4.html">http://www.eightforums.com/performance- ... 81f-4.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />Disk Cleanup / DISM Cleanup / Don't run cleaners<br /><br />DISM /restoreHealth failes with error: 0x800f081f - Page 3 . . . Everything was working fine with the restored disk image that I updated with the &quot;update&quot;, but I decided to run the DISM command to &quot;startcomponentcleanup&quot; and it gave me an error and the DISM restore health command started failing again. From what I read, this DISM component cleanup command is just like doing the Disk Cleanup when including the system files with Windows updates. It is also similar to the Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\StartComponentCleanup which I have now disabled until Microsoft gets a handle on this. Luckily, I imaged the restored drive before playing with it . . . SFC Scan still shows no corruption, but DISM indicates files are repairable. I think since SFC is ok it probably isn't a problem . . . I tried just re-installing Windows as an upgrade using a MSDN 8.1 with update image. All the apps, settings etc weren't touched and now everything is OK. Even used diskcleanup afterwards and dism still works fine . . . Well, my system is updated fine, however I know that I cannot run the DISM startcomponentcleanup command or the disk cleanup w/system files without corrupting my component store . . . I'm still very upset that this KB2919355 update originally caused my component store corruption to begin with, and I have verified that fact by restoring a pre-update image on which I could run all DISM commands without failure. But eventually I had to accept the fact that Microsoft would probably tell me to do a repair install anyway . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.eightforums.com/performance-maintenance/44172-dism-restorehealth-failes-error-0x800f081f-3.html">http://www.eightforums.com/performance- ... 81f-3.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />kb2919355 Component Store corruption - The Hotfix Share . . . I had no problems installing the 8.1 April update, but it introduced the component store corruption issue if I run Disk Cleanup w/System Files or DISM Start Component Cleanup . . . As long as I don't run these, both SFC /SCANNOW and DISM ScanHealth indicate no component store corruption . . . By the way, I copied the DISM.log file (renamed it to .old) to my OneDrive public folder from an image I mounted from when I first installed the updates and ran the Disk Cleanup w/System File and/or DISM /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup utilities that appeared to have corrupted the component store. Note all the Asian (Chinese?) characters that fill the last 90% or so of the log. Please have a look at it: . . . I know that this issue has not been reported on a widespread basis, at least according to Microsoft, but I have seen quite a few posts among several boards. It only seems to affect users who try to reclaim disk space after the update by either running Disk Cleanup w/System Files (including Windows Update) Or by running DISM /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup. And apparently not 100% of the users who do that experience the problem. Hopefully enough people will report this so that MS will take serious note of it . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?s=394713d52ad7acf860eb2b86c83cd70f&amp;showtopic=21423&amp;st=10">http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.p ... 1423&amp;st=10</a><!-- m --><br /><br />DISM /restoreHealth failes with error: 0x800f081f - Page 2 . . . Now I realize that what apparently caused the problem was doing a Disk Cleanup, including system files containing Windows Update files right after the update to reclaim some disk space for my SSD. As long as I don't run Disk Cleanup after the update, all is well. Afterwards I found a post by another user on a Microsoft forum who did essentially the same thing that I did . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.eightforums.com/performance-maintenance/44172-dism-restorehealth-failes-error-0x800f081f-2.html">http://www.eightforums.com/performance- ... 81f-2.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />DISM /restoreHealth fails with 0x800f081f AFTER 8.1 update successfully installed . . . Couldn't pay me enough ever to run something that claims to clean the registry . . . the DISM command to erase old/unused update packages seemed to mess it up again. I will never run that command again, apparently it messes with something that then appears missing to windows . . .  I have found several references to discussions to the effect the update may have introduced a bug wherein RestoreHealth generates the error message when in reality there is no error. Since the update, every time I run RestoreHealth I receive the same error message but the CBS.log shows no corruption . . . I appears that only running the DISM /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup or Disk Cleanup with the system files option corrupts the component store . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/dism-restorehealth-fails-with-0x800f081f-after-81/a83650a9-c515-4bb8-aa7d-298be85e7bc3?page=3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... bc3?page=3</a><!-- m --><br /><br />kb2919355 Component Store corruption - The Hotfix Share . . .

I really wish that MS would acknowledge this DISM component store corruption issue.  If it's just a bogus DISM error message, we need to know that.  And of course, if the component store really is corrupted, that could have some serious consequences going forward and needs to be addressed . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/dism-restorehealth-fails-with-0x800f081f-after-81/a83650a9-c515-4bb8-aa7d-298be85e7bc3?page=9">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... bc3?page=9</a><!-- m --><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />KB2919355<br /><br />kb2919355 Component Store corruption - The Hotfix Share . . . Before I installed yesterday's updates, I looked at the Knowledge Base articles for each one. I noticed that one of the updates KB2969339 was &quot;allegedly&quot; to fix an issue &quot;Error 0x80073712 when you install update 2919355 in Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2&quot;. It said This issue occurs because a new component in update 2919355 contains a file version that is later than the file version that was already installed on the computer and that Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed in the &quot;Applies to&quot; section. Of course it said nothing about the DISM issues, but here is the link to the article: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2969339">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2969339</a><!-- m --> . . . Several users on a Microsoft forum . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/dism-restorehealth-fails-with-0x800f081f-after-81/a83650a9-c515-4bb8-aa7d-298be85e7bc3?page=8&amp;auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/wind ... e=8&amp;auth=1</a><!-- m --> . . . are reporting that this was the update that fixed the problem. . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=21423&amp;st=20">http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.p ... 1423&amp;st=20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />kb2919355 Component Store corruption - The Hotfix Share . . . I received another call about this support case from someone in Product Development. After a brief discussion, he basically said I (and, by extension, others with this problem) may have to re-format. Here are the scenarios as I currently understand them . . . 1. If you A) do not yet have kb2919355 installed (because, say, you refused to install it from Windows Update or it did not install successfully); and B) are unable to successfully run dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, then you will likely have to re-format, regardless of the fix Microsoft will be releasing . . . 2. If you installed kb2919355 and cannot uninstall it, you will also likely have to re-format . . . 3. If you installed kb2919355, are able to successfully uninstall it, and then successfully run dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup , then you will likely NOT have to re-format . . . Incidentally, he also said that this problem affects a lot of people, although he didn't elaborate as to how many. He did say, however, that many others are unable to install kb2919355 in the first place . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=21423&amp;st=20">http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.p ... 1423&amp;st=20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />kb2919355 Component Store corruption, Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 April 2014 update . . . Sadly, this is still an issue.  Turns out I already had the KB2969339 update installed, but not the KB2966870 one. Installed it, but it didn't help me either.  I've included lots of dism logs over here. My major grief right now is that I can't seem to do the Repair Install either. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /> . . . The setup only runs for a few seconds &quot;Preparing xx%&quot;, up to 100%, then it dies, without error messages. My Windows Installer has been broken forever, it seems, and there are a couple of MS Office updates that refuse to install. (Error code 800070641.) And, of course the superlarge 3000850, which is supposed to be a non-critical update. It never installs correctly . . . <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=21423&amp;st=20">http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.p ... 1423&amp;st=20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />KB2969339 - related<br /><br />April 2014 servicing stack update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 . . .

Even if the SFC command doesn’t repair any files, running it will confirm that no system files are corrupted and you can continue to troubleshoot your system with other methods . . .
