If your PC came with Windows 10, chances are that it will have USB 3.0, UEFI, GPT partitions etc and may not have a Compatibility Support Module. It might be hard or impossible to install Windows 7 on it but Windows 8.1 with Classic Shell will give you an experience highly similar to Windows 7.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Tue Aug 02, 2016 11:36 am</p><hr />

I knew the annotations were just mark-ups, but I did like the actual screen design/skin that was illustrated in the sample. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Unfortunately, this is an out-of-the-box new computer that came pre-installed with Windows 10. I suspect my only options are to run 7 virtual or dual, but will need to learn how to do that.<br /><br />We are going to go back to Windows 7 on one of our old computers, but it is really old &amp; slow. The other notebook we have came with 8.1 and we're not fond of that one, either. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />I will keep looking to try to find existing skins similar to the mock-up on the main page, as I do like the simplicity and readability of it ... but at this point don't have the time to try to learn enough to design my own. <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Mahalo for your help!<div align="center"><span style="color:#ffffff;">Save</span></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14451">geckohale</a> — Tue Aug 02, 2016 3:18 am</p><hr />

That is just a screenshot on the homepage with text added to indicate what each UI element is. You don't get that in the actual UI.<br /><br />You can get Classic Task Manager here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/blog/get-classic-old-task-manager-in-windows-10/">http://winaero.com/blog/get-classic-old ... indows-10/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />You can disable the Explorer Ribbon and get back the textual menu bar and command bar by using Ribbon Disabler: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.20">http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.20</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Moving to Windows 10 is not mandatory. You can rollback to Windows 7. Personally, I recommend Windows 7 or 8.1 over Windows 10.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54">Gaurav</a> — Mon Aug 01, 2016 10:36 pm</p><hr />

We just upgraded to Win10 on Friday (we put it off as long as possible). I really miss the clean, easy-to-read, detail-loaded interface I had on my old Win7 machine; and the Win10 stuff just hurts my eyes (I am old <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ). I am also not into all the black/dark menus (again, I am old! <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />).<br /><br />Win10 is just not usable without Classic Shell. The screens give me a headache if I look at them long and I can't even see the icons in the dark/black screens. I also can't make out the text in the taskbar, which is a real handicap.<br /><br />I have played around a bit with the Classic Shell for the Start Menu and it is somewhat better, but I am having problems trying to get the Classic Explorer looking anything like my old Explorer menu.<br /><br />However, I do like the sample one you have displayed on the main page that comes up at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.classicshell.net">http://www.classicshell.net</a><!-- m --> with all the markings &amp; annotations. Is that one available for download to use on Win10? I have searched around the forum trying to find it, but I don't know its name so was not successful.<br /><br />And if there are associated Task Manager and Start Menu skins that match it, I would be very interested in those, too!  <img src="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Mahalo for any help you can provide!!<br /><br />Geckohale in Kona, Hawaii<div align="center"><span style="color:#ffffff;">Save</span></div><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=14451">geckohale</a> — Mon Aug 01, 2016 1:52 pm</p><hr />
