		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />I have been using classic shell for a little while now as a replacement for the search after removing cortona. <br />But there is a feature that I haven't been able to find a setting to turn off. When I press caps lock it has a small grey notification that pops up in the lower right corner of my main monitor that simply says &quot;caps lock&quot;. This is an issue because when I am playing games and push caps lock then this notification causes the fullscreen to hiccup (shows my desktop momentarily) and is very distracting. <br /><br />Despite looking through many settings I have yet to find a way to turn it off. Is this a feature of classic shell, or am I mistaken? Any help?

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />This is not a feature of classic shell, nor is it a feature of any version of windows to my knowledge.<br /><br />If this behavior has been on the computer since the beginning, its likely to be a wonky driver (that some manufacturer decided was a good idea to include) you might have luck opening device manager, and uninstalling the driver for the keyboard, or checking the control panel for any keyboard related entries...<br /><br />If you have a fancy/gaming keyboard it might be part of the included software...<br /><br />otherwise its gotta be something recently installed, so i would start with add/remove programs (first search for anything new, that you don't recall installing, then try anything that runs continually, or tweaks the system. (you can ignore games/standalone programs like media players, and browsers)<br /><br /><br /><br />I know this isn't an ideal solution, but you can also run the game in fullscreen(window) to mitigate the distraction (it should pop-up over the game, but without minimizing it) It will likely cost you 2-5% fps, but will also make switching back/forth much quicker. I personally use it to surf the web for 2-3 minutes while searching for a match in an online game.
