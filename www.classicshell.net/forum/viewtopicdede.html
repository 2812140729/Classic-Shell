To create it I made an actual Rubik's Cube in SketchUp with rotatable sections. I then exported a 2D snapshot of the cube every time I rotated the top and bottom sections by 15 degree increments in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions respectively. I then repeated the processes for the left and right sections. The snapshots were then compiled into a 48x625 png in GIMP, totalling 13 frames.<br /><br />The animation is quick and snappy. Hover over the button to initiate the complete animation, scrambling the cube. Move cursor away to reverse animation, unscrambling the cube.<br /><br />Edit: For anyone interested in a version featuring a pressed state, please click <a href="viewtopice8b0.html?f=18&amp;t=4341&amp;p=18700#p18700" class="postlink">here</a>.

I agree with what you're saying. I might also say that if one is going to have an additional pressed state frame after an animation between the default and hover state, then you would probably agree that the pressed state frame should look noticably different in order to be recognized as the pressed state.<br /><br />The trouble with this is that since animation isn't supported between hover and pressed states, you effectively go from a smooth transition between the default and hover state and then jump to the markedly different pressed state frame without transition. I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion/taste whether this presents an issue - ordinarily its not noticeable in 3 part buttons, but in my opinion this jump begins to look a little strange the longer and more elaborate the animation is between the default and pressed states.

Choose from the attached files below and decide for yourself which, if any you like. The pressed state in the first file simply features an inverted colour scheme. The second features an altered colour palate which I personally think looks more complimentary than the inverted colours. In the third I changed all of the faces to solid white and then made them slightly transparent so that when you click the button the faces take on the colour of your task bar.<br /><br />If anyone desires a different type of pressed state, let me know and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />Edit: also, just for the sake of clarity, the button is configured tp display the first frame by default and then transition through to the second last frame when the mouse hovers over the button. Clicking the button will display the final frame.

You know now that I think about it, for all the hotkeys I generally press day to day I actually almost never press the windows key to access the start menu except in combination with other keys, i.e. windows+E, windoes+D, so the issue you outlined never really occured to me <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />Well, I intend to include unique pressed states from now on.

As things stand, one is responsible for making a button that is essentially an all-in-one product that works out of the box without additional customization and configuration (minus sizing). If Classic Shell were altered so that all one had to do is make the image file used as a button, then configure it to work using the Classic Shell interface, then you're basically forcing people who download your button to replicate those same configurations themselves in Classic Shell in order to get the button to work on their end. For the less savy or willing users, this may be a bridge too far and lead to a lot of problems.
