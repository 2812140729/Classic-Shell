Only items on the file system can be moved, maybe you are trying to move an item defined by a custom command from Customize Start Menu tab? To move that, you must reposition it from the Customize Start Menu tab.<br /><br />If you are moving a file system shortcut or file, does left click and drag work? Left click and drag will create a shortcut by default, if you hold down Shift and left click drag, it will move and if you hold down Ctrl and left click drag, it will copy.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Sounds like a bug. Some changes were made to make the drag/drop more compatible with Windows 8. This may have broken the right-click dragging.<br /><br />Until this is fixed, hold down Shift while dragging to move. The mouse cursor shows what operation will happen. If you see a small [+] in the corner, it will copy. If you see a small arrow, it will create a shortcut. Otherwise it will move. Keep in mind that creating a shortcut to a shortcut actually copies it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />The rules are:<br />1) If you move stuff within the Programs menu, the default operation is MOVE<br />2) If you move stuff from the Programs menu to the main menu, the default operation is SHORTCUT, which in case you are dragging a shortcut is the same as COPY<br />3) At any time you can hold down Shift to force MOVE, hold down Ctrl to force COPY, or both for SHORTCUT<br /><br />The difference between 1 and 2 was done few versions ago to mimic the Windows 7 menu's Pin behavior. When you pin something it doesn't disappear from the original location. Many people were messing up their start menu by trying to pin programs and losing the original shortcut.<br /><br />I am very surprised the Shift key doesn't work for you. I tried moving something from Programs\Adobe to the main menu while holding Shift, and it moved just fine.<br /><br />The mouse cursor should indicate what operation is going to happen - MOVE, COPY or SHORTCUT. Does change change when you press Shift or Ctrl as you are dragging?
